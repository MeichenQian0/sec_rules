<END HEADER>

<h>I. BACKGROUND</h>

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 ("Improvement Act")<sup> 1 </sup> amended sections 24(e) and (f) of the Investment Company Act to create a new, simpler system for the registration of securities under the Securities Act that are issued by open-end management investment companies, unit investment trusts ("UITs") and face-amount certificate companies (collectively, "funds").<sup> 2 </sup> Amended section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act, when effective, will provide that a fund will be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities upon the effective date of its registration statement under the Securities Act.<sup> 3 </sup> The fund then will pay a registration fee within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year based upon the aggregate sale price of fund securities sold during that fiscal year, reduced by the aggregate redemption price of the securities that were redeemed during that year (and during any earlier fiscal year ending on or after October 11, 1995), but that were not used previously by the fund to reduce its registration fees. A fund that makes its fee payment late will be required to pay interest on the unpaid amount at a rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury.<sup> 4 </sup> Amended section 24(f) will provide the exclusive means for registering fund securities under the Securities Act.<sup> 5 </sup>

On July 14, 1997, the Commission issued a release proposing to amend or rescind several rules and forms under the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act to implement the Improvement Act's amendments to section 24 ("Proposing Release").<sup> 6 </sup> The proposals included revisions to Form 24F-2, the Form that is required to accompany fund registration fees. The Commission received seven comment letters, which generally supported the proposed amendments. The Commission is adopting the amendments substantially as proposed.

<h>II. DISCUSSION</h>

<h>A. Amendments to Rule 24f-2</h>

The Commission proposed amending rule 24f-2 to delete provisions made unnecessary as a result of the Improvement Act, to eliminate the requirement that Form 24F-2 be accompanied by an opinion of counsel, and to require the filing of Form 24F-2 within 90 days as required by amended section 24(f). Commenters supported these amendments, which the Commission is adopting as proposed.

The Commission also proposed certain technical amendments to rule 24f- 2 concerning fee payments when a fund ceases operations as a result of a liquidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets (collectively, "merger") of the fund. The Commission is adopting these amendments, modified slightly from the proposal to reflect technical suggestions by commenters.<sup> 7 </sup>

Finally, the Commission is rescinding, as proposed, rule 24e-2 and rule 24f-1, which are no longer necessary as a result of the amendment of section 24(f).

<h>B. Amendments to Form 24F-2</h>

The Commission proposed amendments to Form 24F-2 that would substantially shorten and simplify the form. The Commission is adopting these amendments, modified to reflect comments and to add additional instructions to clarify the operation of rule 24f-2, as amended.

<h>1. Prepaid Shares</h>

Since 1977, rule 24f-2 has permitted a fund to offset its aggregate sales with aggregate redemptions in calculating its registration fee.<sup> 8 </sup> If redemptions exceed sales in a fiscal year, under rule 24e-2 a fund may, under existing rules, use those "redemption credits" to offset registration fees payable for securities registered during the next fiscal year in a post-effective amendment to the fund's registration statement. Shares registered pursuant to rule 24e-2 are, in effect, "pre- paid."

This system has been substantially revised by the Improvement Act. After the effective date of the adopted rule amendments, unused redemption credits from one fiscal year will be available in succeeding fiscal years, and there will be no need to register shares pursuant to a post-effective amendment.<sup> 9 </sup> Before the effective date of these rules, however, some funds will have accumulated a "bank" of pre-paid shares on which a new registration fee need not be paid under section 24(f), as amended. Form 24F-2, currently and as amended, requires that only shares registered pursuant to section 24(f) be included in determining the aggregate shares sold during the year.<sup> 10 </sup> At the suggestion of three commenters, the Commission is adding a new item to the Form that will provide funds space on the Form to reflect information on pre-paid shares, which should assist their personnel in tracking that information.<sup> 11 </sup>

<h>2. Mergers</h>

The Commission is adding two instructions to Form 24F-2 to clarify the operation of the merger provisions of rule 24f-2. The first clarifies that the securities of a fund that are converted or exchanged (the "Predecessor Fund") to those of another (the "Successor Fund") must be treated as redemptions on the Predecessor Fund's final Form 24F-2.<sup> 12 </sup> The second clarifies that, in a reorganization in which the Predecessor Fund is not deemed to cease operations for purposes of rule 24f-2, the Successor Fund assumes the sales and the redemption credits of the Predecessor Fund, which need not file a final Form 24F-2.<sup> 13 </sup>

<h>3. Shares Sold to Unit Investment Trusts</h>

Form 24F-2 has included since its adoption a special instruction that permits a fund to exclude from its aggregate sales, the sales of securities sold to an unmanaged separate account organized as a UIT that itself issued securities on which registration fees have been paid.<sup> 14 </sup> This exclusion was created to prevent "double payment" of registration fees for the same aggregate proceeds from investors in variable insurance products.<sup> 15 </sup> Two commenters argued that the logic of this exclusion supported extending it to funds selling shares to UITs issuing periodic payment plans. The Commission agrees and is revising the instruction to Form 24F-2 to apply to shares sold to any UIT.<sup> 16 </sup>

<h>C. Conforming Amendments</h>

The Commission is adopting, as proposed, amendments to several forms and rules to reflect the revisions to section 24(f) and rule 24f-2 and the rescission of rules 24e-2 and 24f-1.<sup> 17 </sup>

<h>D. Transition/Effective Date</h>

The rule and form amendments adopted today are effective on October 11, 1997, the effective date of the amendments to section 24 of the Investment Company Act. All funds must use Form 24F-2, as revised by these amendments, for filings made on or after October 11, 1997. Funds with a fiscal year ending on or after July 13, 1997 (90 days before October 11, 1997) that file Form 24F-2 on or after October 11, 1997 may net redemptions against sales pursuant to section 24(f) as amended. Funds that file for fiscal years ended after April 14, 1997, but before July 13, 1997 may net redemptions against sales, but must pay interest from the due date of the filing.

Section 24(f), as revised, applies to any fund with an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Commission will consider any fund that has an effective registration statement on October 11, 1997 to have registered, by operation of law, an indefinite amount of shares. After October 11, 1997, when the fund next files its post-effective amendment(s), it should also revise the cover pages of its registration statement to delete statements regarding the indefinite registration of securities.

The October 11, 1997 effective date of the rule and form amendments is less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, pursuant to the "good cause" exception under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). As discussed above, these rule and form amendments are needed to accommodate changes to the statute concerning the registration of securities and the payment of registration fees, and they clarify certain transitional issues that the statutory amendments do not address. In the absence of the amendments adopted today, the current rules and forms would continue to be in effect, even though they do not correspond to the amended statutory provisions. The potential confusion that could result concerning the applicable requirements for funds could be detrimental to investors and to market participants. In addition, because funds are currently required to file Form 24F-2 and the rule and form amendments simplify this process, the Commission does not believe that an accelerated effective date will cause hardship to affected funds. Accordingly, the Commission finds that there is good cause for effectiveness of the rule and form amendments on October 11, 1997.

<h>III. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</h>

In the Proposing Release, the Commission provided a Cost-Benefit Analysis on the amendments and requested comments. No comments were received on these matters. The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits imposed by its rules. The Commission notes that the amendments implement the changes mandated by the Improvement Act to the system for registering fund securities under the Securities Act. The amendments reflect the requirements of amended section 24 of the Investment Company Act and do not impose any additional requirements. The amendments to Form 24F-2 should assist funds in calculating their registration fees and interest, if any, under amended section 24(f). Based on its experience with Form 24F-2, the Commission believes that the benefits to funds and the Commission of having a standardized format for registration fee filings and the guidance provided by the Form outweigh any burdens associated with filing the Form. In the past, Form 24F-2 has made it easier for funds to calculate registration fees and reduced errors in fee calculations. Amended Form 24F-2 would continue these benefits.

The principal economic effect of the amendments is to increase the number of filers of Form 24F-2. The Commission estimates that there will be approximately 500 new filers of the Form. The only new costs that will be imposed for these new filers will be the cost of filing the form annually, which is estimated to average $10 per filer. While in the aggregate there will be more filers of Form 24F-2, the reduction in the amount of time required to file the Form is expected to reduce the total filing costs by $60,120.

The other possible economic effect of the amendments is due to the requirement (also included in the changes made by Congress to section 24) that interest be paid on any registration fees that are paid more than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year. This economic effect also should be insignificant because, based on the Commission's past experience, very few (less than five) registrants annually file Form 24F-2 late.

The Commission estimates that there will be a nearly 50% reduction in the average time it takes filers to complete the Form. The additional guidance provided on the Form will make it easier and less time consuming for investment companies to calculate the registration fees due and to avoid errors in fee calculations. Thus, the amendments will not result in a major increase in either costs or prices. In addition, the amendments should have no adverse effects on efficiency, competition, or capital formation.

<h>IV. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT</h>

As set forth in the Proposing Release, Form 24F-2 contains "collection of information" requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 ("PRA").<sup> 18 </sup> Accordingly, the collection of information requirements contained in the rule amendments were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") for review pursuant to section 3507(d) of the PRA. No comments were received on the proposal with respect to the PRA submission.<sup> 19 </sup> The collection of information requirements are in accordance with section 3507 of the PRA. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the agency displays a valid OMB control number. OMB approved the PRA request and assigned a control number of 3235-0456, with an expiration date of August 31, 2000.

Form 24F-2 provides a standardized format for funds' annual registration fee filings and assists funds in calculating the fees. Form 24F-2 is required to be filed annually. It is estimated that approximately 6681 funds file Form 24F-2. The current average annual burden per respondent for Form 24F-2 is estimated to be 1.9 hours. The total annual burden for all respondents for Form 24F-2 is estimated to be 12,694 hours. The amendments would reduce the annual burden per respondent for Form 24F-2 from 1.9 hours to 1 hour.

The amendments to this collection of information are necessary to implement the changes to section 24 of the Investment Company Act made by the Improvement Act. The information collection requirements imposed by Form 24F-2 are mandatory. Responses to the collection of information will not be kept confidential.

<h>V. SUMMARY OF REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS</h>

A summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, which was prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, was published in the Proposing Release. No comments were received on this analysis. The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis ("FRFA") in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604 regarding the rule and form amendments. The FRFA states that the amendments to rule 24f-2 and Form 24F-2 implement the provisions of the Improvement Act governing registration of fund securities under the Securities Act. The FRFA further states that the conforming amendments to rules and forms conform the relevant provisions to the requirements of amended section 24 of the Investment Company Act. The FRFA indicates that the amendments are designed to make it easier for funds to comply with the new statutory provisions and provide guidance on calculating registration fees on fund securities.

The FRFA sets forth the statutory authority for the amendments. The FRFA also discusses the effect of the amendments on funds that are small entities. For purposes of the amendments, small entities are funds with assets of $50 million or less at the end of their most recent fiscal year. Based on a review of data filed by funds with the Commission, it is estimated that approximately 948 funds may be considered small entities. The FRFA states that the amendments would assist small entities in complying with the new statutory requirements.

The FRFA states that the amendments would not impose any new reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements, and that the Commission believes that there are no rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict with the amendments.

The FRFA discusses the various alternatives considered by the Commission in connection with the amendments that might minimize the effect on small entities, including: (a) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (b) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (c) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (d) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part of the rule, for small entities. Performance, rather than design, standards are incorporated in amended section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act, and are therefore incorporated into the rule and form amendments, to the extent that (i) registration fees on fund shares are based on sales less redemptions, and (ii) a fund is required to pay interest if the registration fee is paid late.

The Commission believes that it would be inconsistent with the purposes of amended section 24 of the Investment Company Act to exempt small entities from the amendments. The Commission considered not having a standardized form to accompany the funds' annual registration fee filings. Based on the Commission's and funds' experience prior to the adoption of Form 24F-2, and the comments received when Form 24F-2 was proposed, however, the Commission believes that Form 24F-2 has been beneficial. Form 24F-2 has made it easier for funds to calculate registration fees and reduced errors in fee calculations.

Different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities are not necessary because the amendments do not establish any new reporting, recordkeeping or compliance requirements. The Commission has determined that it is not feasible to further clarify, consolidate or simplify the amendments for small entities. Cost-benefit information reflected in the "Cost-Benefit Analysis" section of this Release also is reflected in the FRFA. A copy of the FRFA may be obtained by contacting Robin S. Gross, Mail Stop 10-2, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

<h>VI. STATUTORY AUTHORITY</h>

<END MAIN TEXT>

1 Pub. L. No. 104-290 (1996).

2 Section 203 of the Improvement Act (codified at 15 U.S.C. 80a-24(e) and (f)).

3 Section 24(f)(1), as amended. Amended section 24(f) becomes effective on the earlier of October 11, 1997 or the effective date of Commission rulemaking implementing amended section 24(f). See 15 U.S.C. 80a-24 note. For purposes of convenience, section 24, as amended when section 203 of the Improvement Act becomes effective, is referred to in this Release as "amended section 24" or "section 24, as amended."

4 Section 24(f)(3), as amended.

5 Section 203 of the Improvement Act rescinded the provisions of sections 24(e) and (f) that allow for post- effective amendment and post-sale registration of securities. Closed-end management investment companies will continue to register their shares and pay registration fees pursuant to section 6(b) of the Securities Act at the time of the offering.

6 Registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of Certain Investment Company Securities, Investment Company Act Release No. 22747 (July 14, 1997) [62 FR 38495 (July 18, 1997)].

7 The proposed amendments included a provision clarifying that the special rule provisions for reorganizations are not available in a transaction designed to result in the merger of two operating funds. No commenter addressed this proposed clarification, but one commenter urged that the rule treat all mergers as it does reorganizations and permit any unused redemption credits to be assumed by the successor fund. The Commission's proposal entailed merely clarifying the rule's provisions relating to mergers; thus, the commenter's suggestion is beyond the scope of the rule proposal. The Commission believes this suggestion should be addressed only after its consequences can be fully determined, and is therefore adopting the merger provisions as proposed.

8 See Proposing Release, supra note 6 at nn.8-10 and accompanying text.

9 The Improvement Act amended section 24(f) to permit a fund to reduce its registration fee by the aggregate price of securities redeemed during the fiscal year, and any prior fiscal year ending on or after October 11, 1995 that were not used previously to reduce fees payable to the Commission. In this way, amended section 24(f) will permit funds to net redemptions from previous fiscal years without having to "preserve" those redemption credits through filing periodic post-effective amendments pursuant to rule 24e-2, which, as noted above, is being rescinded.

10 Shares registered pursuant to rule 24e-2 may be excluded from the aggregate shares sold. See Item 5(i). Funds may therefore sell pre-paid shares without being required to pay additional registration fees.

11 Item 6 requires the fund to include the information regarding the number of pre-paid shares, if any, that were used to reduce the aggregate sales price of fund shares sold during the fiscal year, and the balance of any pre-paid shares that may remain and are eligible for use in future years. Commenters and others have inquired if there is a specific method they should use when converting a number of pre-paid shares into a dollar amount. The Commission believes that a fund may use any reasonable method that is applied consistently when converting a number of pre-paid shares into a dollar amount for purposes of determining the aggregate price of securities sold during the fiscal year pursuant to rule 24f-2.

12 See Instruction C.2(a).

13 See Instruction C.2(b).

14 See Instruction C.3.

15 See Registration Fees for Certain Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 21332 (Sept. 1, 1995) [60 FR 47041 (Sept. 11, 1995)] at nn.29-31 and accompanying text.

16 See Instruction C.3. In both arrangements, a fund sells shares to a UIT that acts as a mere conduit for the investor's investment in the underlying fund. The Commission believes, therefore, that the rationale for relieving investors in variable insurance products from double payment of registration fees applies with equal force to investors in periodic payment plans. The Commission is not adopting, however, two commenters' suggestion that the instructions permit exclusion of the value of fund shares sold to a management investment company in a "fund- of-funds" arrangement. Unlike the UIT arrangements discussed above, a management company in a fund-of-funds arrangement does not act as a conduit for investments in the other funds.
