<END HEADER>

<h>I. Background </h>

 

On April 14, 1999, the Commission proposed to amend Rule 83, which sets forth the procedures for requesting confidential treatment of records submitted to the Commission when no other procedures apply.<SUP> 1 </SUP> It also proposed to amend Rule 80, which sets forth the procedures for requesting Commission records under the FOIA.<SUP> 2 </SUP> Moreover, it proposed to amend some of its Privacy Act rules, which set forth the procedures for requesting, amending, or correcting Commission records about individuals.<SUP> 3 </SUP> The amendments would make substantive and procedural changes to conform the rules to current statutory and case law and Commission practice. Other changes would correct clerical errors. 

The Commission received eight comment letters.<SUP> 4 </SUP> Commenters generally supported the proposals, but opposed the five-year expiration period for confidential treatment requests as being unduly burdensome. Two suggested changing the period to 10 years.<SUP> 5 </SUP> The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments with certain modifications of the proposed Rule 83 amendments that address some concerns of commenters.<h>II. DiscussionA. Confidential Treatment Rule 83 </h><h>A. Confidential Treatment Rule 83 </h>

1. Scope of the rule

 

The Commission has several rules laying down procedures for requesting confidential treatment of records submitted to it.<SUP> 6 </SUP> The present amendments affect only Rule 83, which sets forth procedures for requesting confidential treatment of records submitted to the Commission where no other statute or Commission rule provides procedures for requesting confidential treatment for particular categories of information or where the Commission has not specified that an alternative procedure be used in connection with a particular study, report, investigation, or other matter.<SUP> 7 </SUP> The scope of Rule 83 is expressly stated in the current version of the rule<SUP> 8 </SUP> and that scope remains unchanged. 

2. Identifying number and code

The current version of Rule 83 generally requires all records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portion thereof to be "marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page, stating `Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]'."<SUP> 9 </SUP> It further provides that, if such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked "Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]" should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested and that each of the records submitted in this manner should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable.<SUP> 10 </SUP> The revised rule, as proposed, requires a person who submits a record to the Commission for which he or she seeks confidential treatment to mark each page or segregable portion of each page with the words "Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]" and an identifying number and code, without regard to the manner in which the records were submitted. The adopted amendment would state, as an example, that a Bates-stamped identifying number or code may be used for this purpose.

3. Voluntarily submitted records

 

A proposed amendment of Rule 83 would have added that a person, who submits a record to the Commission voluntarily and requests its confidential treatment, must mark each page "Voluntarily Submitted" and explain the circumstances under which the record was voluntarily submitted. Several commenters objected to these additional requirements as being unduly burdensome.<SUP> 11 </SUP> They said that voluntary submissions could include hundreds or thousands of pages and the Commission frequently asks for voluntary submission of records. They pointed out that only a small fraction of voluntarily submitted records are ever requested under the FOIA. Upon reconsideration, the Commission has decided not to require that the submitter both mark the record "Voluntarily Submitted" and explain the circumstances under which the record was voluntarily submitted. Rather, although not specified by the rule, an explanation of the circumstances of voluntary submission should continue to be part of a substantiation that the confidential treatment requester furnishes after receiving notice of a FOIA request for the records.

4. Five-year expiration date

 Currently, Rule 83 does not provide an expiration date for confidential treatment requests. A proposed amendment would have stated that a confidential treatment request would expire five years after its receipt by the Commission's FOIA Office unless the person requesting confidentiality renews the request before it expires. Several commenters<SUP> 12 </SUP> noted the difficulty and expense of tracking the contents and expiration date of confidential treatment requests, in light of the frequency with which the Commission asks for voluntary submission of records. Two commenters<SUP> 13 </SUP> suggested a 10-year expiration period as in a similar rule of the U.S. Department of Justice.<SUP> 14 </SUP> The Commission accepts this suggestion. Accordingly, the adopted amendment sets 10 years as the expiration date of confidential treatment requests under Rule 83. The Commission does not plan to notify the confidential treatment requester when the 10 years is about to expire. Moreover, providing an expiration date for such requests does not affect the duration of a grant of confidentiality or the Commission's right to review a grant in light of subsequent events.

5. Substantiation to remain nonpublic

 

A proposed amendment would have stated that a confidential treatment request and a substantiation for it shall be confidential, but if an action is filed in a Federal court by the FOIA or confidential treatment requester, both may become part of the court record. After further consideration, the Commission has decided that both the confidential treatment request and substantiation shall be nonpublic but, if an action is filed in a Federal court under the FOIA, the confidential treatment request or substantiation, or both, may become part of the court record.<h>B. Rule 80 and Privacy Act Rules </h>

 

The Commission received no unfavorable comments on its proposed amendments to Rule 80 or the rules under the Privacy Act.<h>III. Effects On Competition </h>

 

Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act<SUP> 15 </SUP> requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider their anticompetitive effect, if any, and to balance any impact they may have against the regulatory benefits furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that the amendments will have a neutral effect on competition since they would merely conform the rules to current law, clarify procedures for submitting records, and assure voluntary submitters of confidential commercial or financial records that their records will be protected consistent with statutory and case law.<h>IV. Statutory Basis Of Rule Amendments </h>
