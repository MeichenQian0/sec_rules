 Regulation of Takeovers and Security Holder Communications 

 

 AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission

 ACTION: Final Rules

 SUMMARY: We are adopting comprehensive revisions to the rules and regulations applicable to takeover transactions (including tender offers, mergers, acquisitions and similar extraordinary transactions). The revised rules will permit increased communications with security holders and the markets. The amendments also will: balance the treatment of cash and stock tender offers; simplify and centralize the disclosure requirements; and eliminate regulatory inconsistencies in mergers and tender offers. In addition, we are updating the tender offer rules by providing for a subsequent offering period, clarifying certain filing and disclosure requirements and reducing compliance burdens where consistent with investor protection. We believe these revisions will lead to a more well informed and efficient market.

 EFFECTIVE DATE: The rules and amendments will become effective January 24, 2000.

<h>I. Executive Summary and Background </h>

Last fall, we proposed comprehensive changes to the various regulatory schemes applicable to issuer and third-party tender offers, mergers, going-private transactions and security holder communications.<sup> 10 </sup> The proposed changes were prompted by an increase in the number of transactions where securities are offered as consideration; an increase in the number of hostile transactions involving proxy or consent solicitations; and significant technological advances that have resulted in more and faster communications with security holders and the markets. Because these trends have continued since we issued the Proposing Release and commenters, for the most part, viewed the proposals as favorable,<sup> 11 </sup> we are adopting the proposals, with some modification.

As we noted in the Proposing Release, the existing regulatory framework imposes a number of restrictions on communications with security holders and the marketplace. In addition, the disparate regulatory treatment of cash and stock tender offers<sup> 12 </sup> may unduly influence a bidder's<sup> 13 </sup> choice of offering cash or securities in a takeover transaction. We also noted unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements between tender offers and other types of extraordinary transactions, such as mergers.<sup> 14 </sup> Finally, we noted that the multiple regulatory schemes that can apply to a transaction may impose additional compliance costs without necessarily providing a sufficient marginal benefit to security holders. Our goals in proposing and adopting these changes are to promote communications with security holders and the markets, minimize selective disclosure, harmonize inconsistent disclosure requirements and alleviate unnecessary burdens associated with the compliance process, without a reduction in investor protection.<sup> 15 </sup>

We also proposed broad changes to the regulation of securities offerings in a companion release.<sup> 16 </sup> Our proposed treatment of communications in the Securities Act Reform Release differs from our approach in the Proposing Release. The differences were due to the special nature of business combination transactions<sup> 17 </sup> in contrast to capital-raising transactions. At this time we are not adopting the Securities Act Reform proposals that are unrelated to business combination transactions. We are continuing to evaluate commenters' responses to the Securities Act Reform proposals and in the future we may take action on these proposals. We are adopting, however, several proposals in the Securities Act Reform Release that relate to business combination transactions. As a result, some proposals or concepts previously presented in the Securities Act Reform Release are incorporated into this release. Where we proposed changes that would appear in new forms included in the Securities Act Reform Release (Forms C and SB-3), those changes have been implemented in existing forms (Forms S-4 and F-4). In a separate release, we also are adopting significant changes to the regulatory scheme for cross-border tender offers, exchange offers and rights offerings.<sup> 18 </sup>

We believe these new rules and revisions should provide participants in the securities markets sufficient flexibility to accommodate changes in deal structure and advances in technology that continue to occur in today's markets. Briefly, the new rules and amendments adopted today will:

 

relax existing restrictions on oral and written communications with security holders by permitting the dissemination of more information on a timely basis, so long as the written communications are filed on the date of first use; in particular, 

permit more communications before the filing of a registration statement in connection with either a stock tender offer or a stock merger transaction;

permit more communications before the filing of a proxy statement (whether or not a business combination transaction is involved);

permit more communications regarding a proposed tender offer without "commencing" the offer and requiring the filing and dissemination of specified information;

harmonize the various communications principles applicable to business combinations under the Securities Act, tender offer rules and proxy rules; and

eliminate the confidential treatment currently available for merger proxy statements, except when communications made outside the proxy statement are limited to those specified in Rule 135; 

balance the treatment of stock and cash tender offers by permitting both issuer and third-party stock tender offers to commence as early as the filing of a registration statement;

simplify and integrate the various disclosure requirements for tender offers, going-private transactions, and other extraordinary transactions in a new series of rules within Regulation S-K, called "Regulation M-A";

combine the existing schedules for issuer and third-party tender offers into one schedule available for all tender offers, entitled "Schedule TO";

require a "plain English" summary term sheet in all tender offers, mergers and going-private transactions, except when the transaction is already subject to the Securities Act plain English rules;

update the financial statement requirements for takeover transactions; in particular, 

eliminate the requirement to file financial statements for target companies<sup> 19 </sup> in most cash mergers, consistent with the treatment of cash tender offers;

clarify when financial statements of the acquiring company are not required in cash mergers, and when financial statements are required, reduce the financial statements for the acquiror from three years to two; 

clarify when the bidder's financial statements are not required in cash tender offers, and when financial statements are required in third-party offers, reduce the requirement from three years to two;

require pro forma and related financial information in negotiated cash tender offers where the bidder intends to engage in a back-end securities transaction;

reduce the financial statements required for non-reporting target companies in stock mergers and stock tender offers; 

permit an optional subsequent offering period after completion of a tender offer, during which security holders can tender shares without withdrawal rights;

clarify Rule 13e-1, which requires issuers to report intended repurchases of their own securities once a third-party tender offer has commenced;

conform the security holder list requirement in the tender offer rules with the comparable provision in the proxy rules so that the list will include non-objecting beneficial owners; and

clarify the rule that prohibits purchases outside a tender offer (Rule 10b-13), codify prior interpretations of and exemptions from the rule, and redesignate it as Rule 14e-5. 

In several respects the rules adopted today differ from the proposed rule changes. The primary differences are as follows:

 

the Securities Act exemption for communications is extended to all parties to the transaction and any persons acting on their behalf;

the Securities Act exemption also is revised to clarify that an unintentional or immaterial breach of the filing requirement will not result in a loss of the exemption so long as a good faith and reasonable attempt was made to file and the material is filed as soon as practicable after discovery of the failure to file;

a definition of "public announcement" is provided so that parties know when they need to begin filing written communications relating to the transaction and when the prohibition against making purchases outside the tender offer begins;

a written communication relating to a proposed transaction that is a Rule 135 notice must be filed unless the notice only contains information that has already been filed;

the confidential treatment currently available for preliminary merger proxy statements is retained under limited circumstances;

the requirement in expanded Rule 14a-12 to furnish a proxy statement as soon as practicable is revised so that a proxy statement must be furnished at the time a form of proxy is given to or requested from security holders;

written communications permitted under expanded Rule 14a-12 must include either full participant information, as currently required, or a legend directing security holders where they can obtain participant information;

long form publication is retained as a means to commence a tender offer, rather than being eliminated as proposed;

the provision permitting commencement of exchange offers as early as the filing of a registration statement is extended to issuer exchange offers, not limited to third-party offers as proposed;

a bidder that commences an exchange offer early may not be required to deliver a final prospectus to security holders;

an acquiror in a stock merger or stock tender offer need not provide any financial statements for a non-reporting target if the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction and the acquisition is not significant to the acquiror at the 20% level;

subsequent offering period changes: this period can be between three and 20 business days, and is not fixed at ten business days as initially proposed; a bidder is not required to disclose an intent to engage in a back-end merger; and a bidder must announce the results of the initial offering period before beginning the subsequent offering period;

a bidder must disclose pro forma financial information in the first tier of a two-tier transaction for negotiated transactions only, not for transactions where access to the target's financial information is limited;

the information required by Rule 13e-1 regarding issuer repurchases of securities need not be disseminated to security holders; in addition, an exclusion from this rule is provided for certain periodic, routine repurchases; and

several additional exceptions are added to new Rule 14e-5. 

At this time we are not adopting several concepts that we solicited comment on, including:

 

a modification to the proxy rules that would permit the direct delivery of proxy materials to non-objecting beneficial owners;

a federally-mandated proxy solicitation period;

a "test the waters" provision for proxy solicitations;

a requirement that bidders commencing a tender offer by summary advertisement mail their tender offer materials to security holders;

a proxy analogue to the early commencement provision in exchange offers that would permit the sending of proxy cards with "preliminary" proxy materials; and

an expansion of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995<sup> 20 </sup> safe harbor from liability to cover forward-looking statements made in connection with tender offers. 

In the future, depending on the effects of today's rule changes, we may consider proposing additional changes to further harmonize the regulatory requirements.<h>II. Discussion of New Regulatory SchemeA. Overview1. Increased Communications Permitted Before Filing Disclosure Document </h><h>A. Overview1. Increased Communications Permitted Before Filing Disclosure Document </h><h>1. Increased Communications Permitted Before Filing Disclosure Document </h>

Today, merger and acquisition transactions are occurring at a faster pace, due in part to the rapid development of new technologies and advancements in communications. As a result of economic and regulatory pressures, many companies are releasing more information to the market before a registration, proxy or tender offer statement is filed publicly with us.<sup> 21 </sup> In many cases, parties are releasing information on proposed transactions including pro forma financial information for the combined entity, estimated cost savings and synergies. As we noted in the Proposing Release, parties to business combination transactions provide several reasons for the need to disclose information early,<sup> 22 </sup> including the duty under Rule 10b-5 to disclose material information in a manner that is not misleading.<sup> 23 </sup> We also recognize that parties may be subject to other regulatory requirements to disclose information to the markets early.<sup> 24 </sup>

Existing restrictions on communications result primarily from the broad concepts of "offer"<sup> 25 </sup> and "prospectus"<sup> 26 </sup> under the Securities Act, "solicitation"<sup> 27 </sup> under the Exchange Act proxy rules, and "commencement"<sup> 28 </sup> under the Williams Act tender offer rules.<sup> 29 </sup> We recognize that restricting communications to one document may actually impede, rather than promote, informed investing and voting decisions.

We are adopting, as proposed, non-exclusive exemptions under the Securities Act, proxy rules and tender offer rules that permit communications for an unrestricted length of time without a cooling-off period between the end of communications and filing. Written communications made in reliance on the exemptions must be filed. In response to comments, we have modified the exemptions slightly from those proposed, as discussed below.

One major benefit of permitting earlier communications is that more information will be available generally to all security holders, not simply to a limited audience of analysts and financially sophisticated market participants. Because the new rules do not require oral communications to be reduced to writing and filed, some selective disclosure may continue to occur.<sup> 30 </sup> Nevertheless, the rules adopted today are designed to reduce selective disclosure by permitting widespread dissemination of information through a variety of media calculated to inform all security holders about the terms, benefits and risks of a planned extraordinary transaction. We believe that parties to business combination transactions generally wish to inform the marketplace at large about their deals, and will use the new rules to accomplish this end. The new regulatory scheme is not intended to be used as a means to substitute selective oral disclosure for written and oral disclosure that becomes public on a widespread basis.<sup> 31 </sup> Although this release does not impose new requirements on oral communications, we remain extremely troubled by the selective disclosure of material information.<sup> 32 </sup> The staff is considering broader regulatory approaches to limit or inhibit written and oral selective disclosure by issuers in all contexts, including those addressed in this release. If we decide to pursue these approaches, we will issue a separate release seeking public comment.<sup> 33 </sup>

The scheme we adopt today provides the maximum amount of flexibility to disclose information to security holders and the markets.<sup> 34 </sup> This new communications scheme, however, does not change the current requirement that security holders receive a mandated disclosure document before they are asked to make a voting or investment decision ( e.g. , a prospectus, proxy statement, or tender offer statement setting forth complete and balanced information).<sup> 35 </sup> Of course, security holders may buy or sell in the market before they receive the mandated disclosure document. That is true under the current regulatory scheme as well as under the new one. Under the new rules, security holders are likely to have information about the transaction at an earlier point in time, and they can choose to act on this information or wait for the complete disclosure document.

While it is possible under the new scheme to announce a proposed transaction long before a mandated disclosure document is filed, we do not believe acquirors will delay the filing of a mandated disclosure document unnecessarily because the longer they wait the greater the risk that market forces will affect the terms of the deal or another potential acquiror will announce a competing transaction. We believe that companies announcing a transaction should, and we encourage them to, file the mandated disclosure document as soon as possible after announcing a proposed transaction.

Our long-held concern regarding communications that could condition the market before dissemination of a mandated disclosure document is mitigated by the continuing requirement to deliver a disclosure document before any voting or investment decision can be made, and the attendant liability for false or misleading statements. Communications made in reliance on the new exemptions would, of course, be subject to Section 10(b) liability.<sup> 36 </sup> We remind persons relying on the exemptions that fraudulent statements in these communications could not be cured by subsequent filings. In light of these considerations, we believe that the benefits conferred on the marketplace by the disclosure of more information on a timely basis outweigh the risks that the information will be incomplete or potentially misleading.<h>2. Eligibility </h>

Our proposals did not make distinctions based on size and seasoned status. Due to the extraordinary nature of business combination transactions, security holders and the markets need full and timely information regarding those transactions regardless of the size or seasoned status of the companies involved. We recognized the inherent difficulties in selecting the appropriate focus for purposes of applying an eligibility test ( i.e. , should you look at the status of the acquiror, the target or the combined entity?). All commenters who addressed the issue agreed with our view. Therefore, the exemptions are adopted as proposed, without any eligibility requirements.

We also asked whether the exemptions should be limited to the parties to the transaction or available to others who may be acting on behalf of the parties to the transaction. In particular, we noted that in a third-party stock offer the company to be acquired would not ordinarily be subject to the Securities Act restrictions on communications, but under certain circumstances, it could be viewed as joining with the acquiror in making the offer. In that case, the exemptions would need to extend to additional parties. In addition, we asked whether the parties' affiliates, dealer-managers, and others acting on behalf of the parties to the transaction should be permitted to rely on the exemption. Again, most commenters were consistent in recommending that we expand the exemptions to these persons. While we realize that in many circumstances the exemptions would not be necessary for persons other than the parties to the transaction or the party making the offer, we want to encourage full, complete and continuous communications with security holders.

 Therefore, we are adopting the exemptions to cover all persons acting on the parties' behalf.<h>3. Written Communications with Legend Filed on Date of First Use </h>

We are adopting, as proposed, a condition to the communications exemptions that all written communications in connection with or relating to a business combination transaction be filed on or before the date of first use.<sup> 37 </sup> In addition, all written communications must include a prominent legend advising investors to read the registration, proxy or tender offer statement, as applicable.<sup> 38 </sup> We believe that a prompt filing requirement is necessary to protect security holders and assure that these communications are available to all investors on a timely basis.<sup> 39 </sup> In most cases, this information will need to be filed electronically via the EDGAR System, and thus will be rapidly disseminated to the marketplace.<sup> 40 </sup>

In the Proposing Release, we asked whether parties relying on the exemptions should be permitted to file written communications on a later date ( e.g. , when the mandated disclosure document is filed or some other date). While several commenters viewed the requirement as reasonable, a few believed it would be burdensome. The latter group of commenters stated that a same-day filing requirement could cause parties to delay the release of information. These commenters believed that communications that would otherwise be made late in the day will be postponed until the materials can be filed on the same day. We believe, however, that in most cases parties to business combination transactions will be able to time their communications so that it is possible to file them on the same day they are made. Also, Rule 13(d) of Regulation S-T permits communications that are made outside of the Commission's business hours to be filed electronically as soon as practicable on the next business day.<sup> 41 </sup> Further, we have clarified that an immaterial or unintentional delay in filing will not preclude reliance on the Securities Act exemption.<sup> 42 </sup>

The filing requirement applies to written communications that are made public or are otherwise provided to persons that are not a party to the transaction.<sup> 43 </sup> As a general matter, this would include, for example, scripts used by parties to the transaction to communicate information to the public and other written material ( e.g. , slides) relating to the transaction that is shown to investors.<sup> 44 </sup> In contrast, internal written communications provided solely to parties to the transaction, legal counsel, financial advisors, and similar persons authorized to act on behalf of the parties to the transaction would not need to be filed. Also, as explained in the Proposing Release, business information that is factual in nature and relates solely to ordinary business matters, and not the pending transaction, would not need to be filed. We expect that filing persons will apply traditional legal principles in determining whether a particular written communication is made in connection with or relates to a proposed business combination transaction.<sup> 45 </sup>

Several commenters criticized the proposed filing requirement because it could result in the filing of duplicative or substantially similar information when similar communications are made over time. In response to this concern, we are clarifying that any republication or redissemination of the same information would not need to be filed again to comply with the exemptions. If, however, information is either added to or changed from the content of an earlier communication, then the revised written communication must be filed.<sup> 46 </sup><h>B. Communications Under the Securities Act1. Securities Act Exemption and Filing Rules </h><h>1. Securities Act Exemption and Filing Rules </h>

We are exercising our exemptive authority to create an exemption that will permit more communications with security holders and the markets regarding a planned business combination transaction.<sup> 47 </sup> We find that free communications relating to business combination transactions are in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors. Accordingly, we adopt new Rules 165, 166<sup> 48 </sup> and 425<sup> 49 </sup> and amend Rules 135 and 145.<sup> 50 </sup> These new and amended rules permit parties to communicate freely about a planned business combination transaction before a registration statement is filed, as well as during the waiting period and post-effective periods, so long as their written communications used in connection with or relating to the transaction are filed beginning with the first public announcement<sup> 51 </sup> and ending with the close of the proposed transaction.<sup> 52 </sup> As noted in the Proposing Release, these communications are not excluded from the definition of "offer" in the Securities Act,<sup> 53 </sup> as no content restriction is imposed on the communications.<sup> 54 </sup> Instead, new Rule 165 exempts persons making these communications from Sections 5(b)(1) and (c) of the Securities Act.<sup> 55 </sup>

New Rules 165 and 166 are available only for business combination transactions. New Rule 165 defines a business combination transaction as a transaction specified in Rule 145(a) or an exchange offer. Thus, either the proxy rules or the tender offer rules must be applicable to the transaction. We have added a preliminary note to Rules 165 and 166 to state that the exemption is not available to communications that may technically comply with the rule, but have the primary purpose or effect of conditioning the market for a capital-raising or resale transaction.<sup> 56 </sup><h>2. Liability for Communications </h>

As proposed, both oral and written communications made in reliance on the Securities Act exemption would be offers subject to Section 12(a)(2) liability, based on the belief that this level of liability would adequately protect investors without chilling communications.<sup> 57 </sup> Approximately half the commenters who addressed the issue agreed with the proposed liability standard, while the others believed that this potential level of liability could have a chilling effect on communications.

We are adopting the proposed regulatory scheme. To the extent that these communications constitute offers, they currently would be subject to Section 12(a)(2) liability. As a result, we do not believe that the adopted rules alter the current liability levels for these communications.<sup> 58 </sup> In light of the extensive pre-filing communications that are ongoing in the marketplace now with respect to business combination transactions, we believe that a Section 12(a)(2) standard of liability would not significantly chill communications.

Several commenters also indicated that the proposed Section 5(c) exemption should not be conditioned on timely filing of all written communications. Commenters were concerned that a failure to timely file a written communication could result in a loss of protection under the exemption, resulting in a Section 5 violation that would give security holders a right of rescission. In proposing the filing requirement, we did not intend to provide security holders with an automatic right of rescission if a communication is either filed late or there is an unintentional failure to file. To clarify this issue, we are revising the filing requirement in new Rule 165 to state that an immaterial or unintentional failure to file or delay in filing will not result in a loss of the exemption from Section 5(b)(1) or (c), so long as a good faith and reasonable attempt to file the written communication is made and the communication is filed as soon as practicable after discovery of the failure to file.<sup> 59 </sup><h>3. Rules 135 and 145 </h>

Currently, Rule 135 provides that disclosure of certain limited information in notice form will not be deemed an "offer" for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act.<sup> 60 </sup> A Rule 135 notice is typically made upon announcement of a proposed securities offering before a registration statement is filed.<sup> 61 </sup> Rule 145(b)(1) contains a similar provision regarding the information in a stock merger that will not be deemed a "prospectus" or "offer."<sup> 62 </sup>

We proposed several revisions to Rules 135 and 145 in the Proposing Release and the Securities Act Reform Release. In particular, we proposed moving the substance of Rule 145(b)(1) to Rule 135, as both rules contain similar provisions regarding the information that will not be deemed an offer. We are adopting those revisions.<sup> 63 </sup>

In addition to the changes proposed, we asked whether Rule 135 notices should be filed. Although Rule 135 does not currently require these notices to be filed, in many cases the 135 notice would be the first written communication relating to a proposed business combination transaction. We believe it is important for this information to reach the marketplace promptly and on a widespread basis. Generally, these notices are short documents ( e.g. , press release or other form of written notice of an intended offer). Currently, the first press release or other written communication announcing a proposed business combination transaction often is filed under cover of Form 8-K.<sup> 64 </sup> In addition, under the new regulatory scheme these communications would have to be filed under the proxy or tender offer rules, if applicable. As a result, we do not believe that a filing requirement for the first public communication regarding a business combination will impose a significant burden.

We are adopting a filing requirement that encompasses Rule 135 notices. These notices must be filed under new Rule 425 because they are written communications relating to a proposed transaction. Even though we are requiring these notices to be filed, our rules provide that they will not constitute offers and therefore will not have Section 12(a)(2) prospectus liability.<sup> 65 </sup> In addition, subsequent notices or announcements made under Rule 135 that do not contain new or different information are not required to be filed. This approach is consistent with the filing requirement under each of the three regulatory schemes.<h>4. Public Announcement </h>

Under the terms of the exemptions, written communications must be filed beginning with the first public announcement of the business combination transaction. Today we are adopting a specific definition of "public announcement" that encompasses all communications that put the market on notice of a proposed transaction. For purposes of determining when a filing obligation is incurred under the exemptions, "public announcement" means any communication by a party to the transaction, or any person authorized to act on a party's behalf, that is reasonably designed to, or has the effect of, informing the public or security holders in general about the transaction.<sup> 66 </sup> We asked in the Proposing Release whether the term "public announcement" should be defined, and if so, how it should be defined. Although the commenters that responded favored a bright line definition, they opposed a broad definition that could potentially create difficulties in determining when a filing obligation is triggered.

We agree that a definition is necessary, but we believe that the definition should be sufficiently broad to cover communications that are reasonably designed to, or have the effect of, putting the markets or the security holders on notice of a proposed transaction. We do not believe the definition should be so narrow that the parties must actually intend to effect a broad dissemination of the information.<sup> 67 </sup><h>C.

We are revising Rule 14a-12,<sup> 68 </sup> substantially as proposed, to permit both written and oral communications before the filing of a proxy statement so long as all written communications related to the solicitation are filed on the date of first use.<sup> 69 </sup> This is the same filing requirement adopted for the communications exemption under the Securities Act.<sup> 70 </sup> This exemption is not limited to business combination transactions, but is available regardless of the subject matter of the solicitation. Oral communications do not need to be reduced to writing and filed. In revising Rule 14a-12, we retain substantially all the proposed conditions to reliance on the exemption. These conditions are that no form of proxy is furnished until a proxy statement is delivered, the obligation to disclose participant information, and the requirement to file all written communications with a prominent legend advising security holders to read the proxy statement.

As a result of these changes to Rule 14a-12, management can communicate more freely with security holders about significant corporate events, including a proposed merger or acquisition, or other significant corporate governance matters that may require a security holder vote. Likewise, security holders are able to communicate more freely with one another. The revised rule does not, however, expand a company's or security holder's ability to secure promises to vote a certain way before a proxy statement is provided.<sup> 71 </sup> The expansion of Rule 14a-12 to non-contested matters is premised on the same rationale for increasing communications related to business combination transactions under the Securities Act. We recognize the many recent developments in technology that have enabled companies to communicate more frequently with security holders at a significantly reduced cost. In addition, security holders and the markets are demanding more information from public companies about new developments and proposed transactions. In light of the rapid pace of change in the securities markets and developments in technology, we believe the time has come to update the proxy rules to permit security holder communications to flow more freely and to facilitate a more informed security holder base.

We believe that the requirement to file all written communications, the condition that no proxy or form of proxy be furnished to security holders before a written proxy statement is delivered, and the requirement to include a legend on all written communications advising security holders to read the proxy statement and where to find participant information should be sufficient to protect against misleading solicitations. Together with the antifraud provisions of Rule 14a-9,<sup> 72 </sup> these requirements should maintain the integrity of the solicitation process and adequacy of information disseminated to security holders.<sup> 73 </sup> In addition to these safeguards, security holders will receive a complete proxy statement before they can vote.

In the Proposing Release we solicited comment on whether a federally mandated proxy solicitation period would be appropriate for mergers and similar transactions in light of the free communications permitted under the exemption. We noted that security holders may need a minimum amount of time ( e.g. , 20 business days), similar to that in tender offers, to digest the free communications together with the information in the proxy statement. Most commenters that responded to this question were opposed to a minimum solicitation period. Because this is an area that traditionally has been governed by state corporate law, and in light of the improved ability of security holders to access information though electronic means, we believe that the existing solicitation periods are adequate. We are not adopting a minimum solicitation period at this time.

We also asked whether the proxy rules should be amended to permit direct delivery of proxy statements and other soliciting materials to non-objecting beneficial owners to facilitate more timely and informed voting decisions. We were concerned that security holders holding securities in street name may not receive materials from banks, broker-dealers, or other nominees in a timely fashion. While we believe that direct delivery of proxy materials to non-objecting beneficial owners may have benefits for security holders, at this time we reserve this concept for a future rulemaking project.

a. The "As Soon as Practicable" Requirement

Many of the commenters urged us to revise the current and proposed condition in Rule 14a-12 that a written proxy statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14A be sent or given to solicited security holders at the earliest practicable date. These commenters pointed out that, in practice, when the purpose of a solicitation becomes moot or the solicitation is otherwise discontinued, persons making pre-filing communications in reliance on the rule generally do not, and should not be required to, send security holders a written proxy statement. We recognize that literal adherence to the delivery requirement in Rule 14a-12 in circumstances where a solicitation is canceled prematurely may not provide a significant benefit to security holders, but could result in unnecessary costs to the soliciting parties and potentially mislead security holders into believing that the solicitation is ongoing.

In view of these concerns, current practice, and the overall approach to communications adopted today, we are eliminating the current "as soon as practicable" requirement. As revised, Rule 14a-12 requires that a definitive proxy statement be furnished to security holders when a form of proxy is either given to or requested from security holders.<sup> 74 </sup> When proxies are first requested from security holders the mandated disclosure document must be delivered to them so they can make informed voting decisions. This approach is consistent with the delivery requirements adopted under the other regulatory schemes.<sup> 75 </sup> As a result, parties relying on the rule are not obligated to furnish a written proxy statement if the solicitation is discontinued for any reason. If a solicitation is discontinued, we believe it would be appropriate for the soliciting persons to inform previously solicited security holders that the solicitation is over and provide a brief explanation of why it is being canceled.

b. Participant Information

We are modifying the current requirement to disclose participant information in proxy materials. Instead, the revised rule requires a prominent legend on written communications advising security holders where they can obtain a detailed list of the names, affiliations and interests of participants in the solicitation.<sup> 76 </sup> Of course, the soliciting materials could include the participant information in full, as currently required, instead of a legend.

The legend may refer to either a previously filed communication that contains the participant information, or a separate statement that contains the participant information and is filed as Rule 14a-12 material.<sup> 77 </sup> We are not eliminating the requirement to make participant information available to security holders. Rather, we are requiring disclosure of this information once instead of in every communication.

c."Test the Waters"

In addition to our proposal to expand Rule 14a-12, we solicited comment on adopting a broader "test the waters" approach to proxy solicitations. Under this approach, parties could engage in soliciting activities without filing proxy material so long as no form of proxy is requested or sent. Test the waters would permit both written and oral proxy solicitations before the filing of a proxy statement. Unlike the proposed expansion of Rule 14a-12, however, test the waters would not require written communications to be filed on first use.

Many commenters favored our concept of test the waters, but a few commenters expressed concern that it could result in unregulated and secret solicitations. At this time, we believe that our expansion of Rule 14a-12, as adopted, should provide sufficient flexibility to companies to communicate more frequently with security holders on a timely basis. After we gain some experience with communications under the expanded Rule 14a-12, depending on its effects, we may consider moving toward a test the waters approach in future rulemaking.<h>2. Limited Confidential Treatment of Merger Proxy Materials </h>

Today, a proxy statement relating to a merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar matter may be filed confidentially with the Commission.<sup> 78 </sup> If the staff decides to review the proxy statement it may issue comments to the filing parties. When all comments are resolved, a public filing is made _ either a definitive proxy statement or, if securities are being offered, a registration statement that wraps around the proxy statement. We proposed to eliminate the provision for confidential treatment. We note the practice of disclosing extensive deal-related information to the market before a registration statement or proxy statement is filed publicly. We do not believe that material public information regarding a merger should receive confidential treatment.

Many commenters opposed eliminating confidential treatment due to a concern for increased liability. These commenters pointed out that they may be required to make revisions to their proxy statement disclosure in response to staff comment that would be subject to unnecessary public scrutiny. It is not clear, however, why the proxy statement situation warrants different treatment from exchange offers and other public filings that are routinely amended in response to staff comment. One commenter suggested that we retain confidential treatment when the parties to a transaction do not publicly disclose information about the transaction outside the proxy statement.

We have decided to retain confidential treatment under limited circumstances. Where the parties to a merger or other business combination transaction limit their public communications to those specified in Rule 135,<sup> 79 </sup> confidential treatment will continue to be available for the proxy materials. If, however, the parties elect to publicly disclose, either orally or in writing, information relating to the transaction that goes beyond Rule 135, confidential treatment will not be available.<sup> 80 </sup>

As a result, the parties to the transaction may choose either to forgo confidential treatment and communicate publicly about the deal in reliance on one of the new exemptions, or invoke confidential treatment and refrain from any publicity outside the proxy statement, except for the basic information permitted by Rule 135. We will use Rule 135 as a bright line in determining whether parties to a transaction have publicly disclosed sufficient information to the point that confidential treatment of the proxy materials is no longer warranted. This bright line will be applied whether or not the transaction is subject to the Securities Act and Rule 135. If a preliminary proxy statement is filed confidentially, but information beyond Rule 135 is subsequently disclosed, confidential treatment will no longer be available and all proxy materials related to the transaction must be filed publicly.

Two commenters recommended that we institute a procedure that would allow parties to seek an expedited, confidential pre-filing review of pro forma financial statements and other accounting matters if confidential treatment is eliminated. Currently, parties are permitted to, and frequently do, initiate pre-filing conferences with our accounting staff to resolve sensitive accounting issues before the filing a merger proxy statement. Our accounting staff will continue to be available for pre-filing conferences with filing parties.

Several commenters also indicated that if we decided to eliminate confidential treatment, we should not require that all exhibits be filed with the first public filing of the proxy statement. These commenters noted that in many cases some exhibits may not exist or are not in final form when the proxy statement is first filed. The limitation on confidential treatment adopted today would not require that all exhibits be filed with the initial filing of a proxy statement. As is the case today, a proxy statement may be filed first, without any exhibits. Schedule 14A does not have any exhibit requirements. Exhibits could be filed at a later date when the registration statement is wrapped around the proxy statement. If all exhibits are not final or complete at the time the registration statement is first filed, then those exhibits could be filed in an amendment to the combined proxy statement/registration statement.<h>3. Timing of Filings </h>

Rule 14a-6(b) requires that definitive proxy materials be "filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission not later than the date such material is first sent or given to security holders."<sup> 81 </sup> Similar language appears in several other proxy and information statement filing rules.<sup> 82 </sup> The mailing alternative, however, is no longer an option because companies must file electronically.<sup> 83 </sup> Therefore, we are amending the proxy and information statement filing rules as proposed to require filing no later than the date the materials are first sent or given to security holders.<sup> 84 </sup> This change is consistent with the filing requirements imposed under the exemptions adopted today.

We continue to believe that definitive materials should be available to security holders, the market and the staff as promptly as possible. EDGAR and other electronic sources of information, including the Internet, increasingly are relied upon by the investment community for information regarding public companies. When there is a lag between the time information is first disseminated and the time it is filed, persons relying on our filings for information on public companies are placed at a disadvantage.<h>D. Communications Under the Tender Offer Rules1. "Commencement," Communications, and Filing Requirements </h><h>1. "Commencement," Communications, and Filing Requirements </h>

Currently, the tender offer rules restrict a third-party bidder's communications regarding a proposed tender offer. The restrictions on communications stem from the concept of "commencement," the five business day rule for cash tender offers,<sup> 85 </sup> and the requirement that a registration statement be filed promptly for registered exchange offers.<sup> 86 </sup> A target's communications regarding a tender offer are similarly restricted.<sup> 87 </sup> To harmonize the treatment of communications regarding business combination transactions under the three regulatory schemes, and to promote the dissemination of information to all security holders on a more timely basis, we are modifying the definition of "commencement" and eliminating the five business day rule and the requirement to promptly file a registration statement after announcing a registered exchange offer.<sup> 88 </sup>

In place of these rules, we are adopting a filing requirement for all written communications that relate to a tender offer beginning with and including the first public announcement of the transaction.<sup> 89 </sup> As with communications subject to the Securities Act and the proxy rules, written communications must be filed on the date that the communication is made.<sup> 90 </sup> In addition, written communications must contain a legend advising security holders to read the full tender offer or recommendation statement when it becomes available.

Under the revised rules, "commencement" is when the bidder first publishes, sends or gives security holders the means to tender securities in the offer.<sup> 91 </sup> We believe that security holders need the information required by the tender offer rules when they are either asked or able to tender their securities in an offer.<sup> 92 </sup>

To minimize the potential for dissemination of false offers into the marketplace in the absence of the five business day rule, we are adopting new Rule 14e-8. As proposed, this rule prohibits bidders from announcing an offer: without an intent to commence the offer within a reasonable time and complete the offer; with the intent to manipulate the price of the bidder or the target's securities; or without a reasonable belief that the person will have the means to purchase the securities sought. We believe that a specific rule prohibiting such conduct is appropriate. This antifraud rule is intended as a means to prevent fraudulent and misleading communications regarding proposed offers under the new communications scheme, in addition to the existing antifraud provisions.

Two commenters expressed concern that the rule could create new grounds for frivolous litigation, while others supported the proposal. Of course, if a target or other party decided to litigate under this new rule, the plaintiff would have the burden of showing that the bidder either did not have an intent to commence and complete the offer or did not reasonably believe it had the ability to purchase the securities. Although not required, a commitment letter or other evidence of financing ability ( e.g. , funds on hand or an existing credit facility) would in most cases be adequate to satisfy the rule's requirement that the bidder have a reasonable belief that it can purchase the securities sought.<sup> 93 </sup>

Although we noted in the Proposing Release that eliminating the current restrictions could have potentially destabilizing effects on the securities markets,<sup> 94 </sup> it is not clear that the market effects differ greatly from those caused by merger announcements, which are not subject to the same constraints. Based on our experience with tender offers<sup> 95 </sup> and the factors discussed above influencing our decision to permit more communications regarding business combination transactions, we believe that the availability of more information on a timely basis will better assist security holders in making well informed individual investment decisions when confronted with news of a pending or proposed business combination. Accordingly, we are adopting the changes to the tender offer communications provisions substantially as proposed.

In reaching this conclusion, we note that communications regarding issuer tender offers are not similarly restrained.<sup> 96 </sup> Also, it appears that some bidders do not use the term "tender offer" in their public announcement of a proposed business combination transaction in an attempt to avoid triggering application of Rule 14d-2. Furthermore, security holders today, upon hearing news of a proposed tender offer for their securities (either directly by the formal notice published by the bidder or indirectly through rumors in the marketplace), must decide whether to: (i) retain their securities until a tender offer statement is filed and disseminated so they can tender into the offer; or (ii) sell into the market at prevailing prices based on the limited information available.<sup> 97 </sup> Under the new approach, more time may elapse between announcement and the filing of the tender offer statement, but more information also may be available during that period. We do not believe there is a sufficiently compelling basis to continue treating third-party cash offers, exchange offers, issuer tender offers and mergers differently.<sup> 98 </sup>

Most of the commenters that addressed the proposals favored eliminating the five business day rule and the requirement to promptly file a registration statement after announcement of an exchange offer, as well as the revised definition of "commencement." A few commenters, however, expressed concern that elimination of the five business day rule could revive certain inconsistent state law requirements. We do not believe that elimination of the five business day rule will result in a resurgence of inconsistent state anti-takeover statutes that impose disclosure or other requirements incompatible with our new regulatory scheme.

We have long defined when a tender offer commences. This definition served several purposes, including implementing a uniform nationwide timetable for the tender offer process, regulating the flow of information by identifying the date by which required disclosure filings must be made with the Commission, and helping to create a level playing field between bidders and targets. Under well-established principles, any state law that conflicted with this provision was preempted.

The new definition continues to serve these sorts of purposes _ it establishes a uniform time at which a tender offer is deemed to commence, it continues to balance the rights and obligations of bidders and targets, and it facilitates the free flow of information from both bidders and targets before that date (subject to the antifraud provisions), based on our judgment that this flow of information is in the best interests of the holders of securities. The elimination of the five business day rule and the other changes in the rule are intended to provide security holders with the broadest possible disclosure of information at the earliest date possible.

We believe that courts would hold that any state law that conflicted with the new rule by attempting to establish a different commencement date or otherwise frustrating operation of the rule would be preempted.<sup> 99 </sup> For instance, we believe that any state provision that made it impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements or that created obstacles to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the new rule would continue to be preempted.<sup> 100 </sup>

Security holders ultimately have the choice to sell into the market based on information disclosed early or wait until a complete, mandated disclosure document is sent to them before making an investment decision. The ability of security holders to sell into the market before a complete disclosure document is filed and disseminated is no different from their current position between the time a transaction is announced and the time a mandated disclosure document is filed and disseminated. However, we believe that liberalizing early communications will better serve investors and the markets by providing them with more information at an earlier date. The bidder continues to have the flexibility to commence promptly after the first public announcement. We encourage bidders to commence their offers as soon as they are able to do so, since security holders and other market participants will benefit from the complete information in the mandated tender offer materials. To the extent, however, that there are delays between announcement and commencement, we believe that investors will benefit from the free flow of information provided by the new regulatory scheme. Therefore, we are changing the current regulatory scheme, and in doing so we are clearly expressing our intent that these new rules serve, as an integrated whole, to regulate the various communications that persons may make regarding a potential or proposed business combination transaction.

Two commenters favored retaining the five business day rule for hostile offers, but eliminating it for negotiated transactions. We believe, however, that applying the rule only to hostile offers could present problems when the same target is the subject of both a negotiated transaction and a hostile offer, or when a negotiated transaction becomes hostile as a result of changed circumstances or another offer. Further, in light of the communications scheme we adopt today, it does not appear that security holders' best interests would be served by permitting expanded communications only with respect to negotiated transactions.

One commenter believed that the five business day rule provides investors and the markets with a degree of certainty regarding proposed offers and results in the dissemination of better information in a relatively short time. We believe that our requirements to file all written communications relating to a proposed transaction on first use will result in more information on a timely basis. As noted above, we do not believe bidders will have an incentive to unnecessarily delay commencing their offers because of the risk that market forces may affect the terms of the offer or a competing bidder will emerge.

Under these new and revised rules, bidders and targets alike have an increased ability to communicate with security holders along with the requirement to file all written communications related to an offer. Under the new scheme, the target must file all written communications relating to the transaction on the date the communication is made.<sup> 101 </sup> Targets need not file a formal recommendation statement until after the offer is formally commenced and a recommendation is made. The target remains obligated, however, to take a position with respect to the offer no later than 10 business days after the offer commences under Rule

14d-2.<sup> 102 </sup> If the target makes a recommendation after commencement, but before the tenth business day, then it must file a recommendation/solicitation statement on Schedule 14D-9 on or before the time the recommendation is first made.

These rules apply to issuer and third-party tender offers alike. In addition, the new rules make no distinction based on the form of consideration offered to security holders ( e.g. , cash or stock). We do not believe that there is sufficient justification to treat tender offer communications differently based on either the nature of the bidder or the consideration offered. Security holders ultimately face the same investment decision -- whether or not to tender in the offer.<h>2. Dissemination Requirements </h>

We also reviewed the various methods to commence a tender offer in the Proposing Release.<sup> 103 </sup> In reviewing these methods, we noted that long form publication<sup> 104 </sup> is rarely used by bidders due to the cost associated with publishing extensive information about the offer in a newspaper.<sup> 105 </sup> We proposed to eliminate long form publication.

Several commenters agreed that long form publication is rarely used, but urged us to retain the method, citing the lack of any abuse under the rule. In addition, these commenters noted that, in the future, long form publication may become a viable means of disseminating an offer using the Internet or another electronic delivery system. At this time, we do not believe that technology has developed to the point where bidders can rely solely on electronic media to disseminate information about a tender offer to security holders. In particular, posting the information on a web site alone would not be adequate dissemination.<sup> 106 </sup> Nevertheless, in response to commenters' requests that we retain long form publication as a means of commencement, we have decided not to eliminate it.

We solicited comment on whether the rules should continue to permit an offer to be commenced and disseminated by summary advertisement alone.<sup> 107 </sup> Currently, bidders that rely on the summary advertisement method to disseminate an offer tend also to mail their offering documents to security holders using a security holder list under Rule 14d-5. We asked whether bidders should always be required to use security holder lists when disseminating an offer. Two commenters favored retaining summary publication without the use of security holder lists. Both cited the lack of any abuse with the rule and the possibility that its elimination could force bidders to tip their hand when requesting a security holder list from the target in hostile transactions. Accordingly, we are not changing this aspect of the summary advertisement rule.<sup> 108 </sup> However, in keeping with the expansion of permissible communications, we are eliminating, as proposed, the current restriction on the information that may be included in a summary advertisement.<sup> 109 </sup>

Currently, bidders must hand deliver a copy of their tender offer statement and any additional tender offer materials to the target company as well as any other bidder that has made an offer for the same class of securities.<sup> 110 </sup> We proposed a similar delivery requirement for the first written communication disclosing a proposed offer. Under the new communications scheme for tender offers, bidders are able to disclose information about a proposed offer without commencing the offer.<sup> 111 </sup> In light of the many different communications media available to bidders, we believe targets need a reliable way to learn about proposed offers for their securities so they can respond in a timely manner. Therefore, we are adopting a requirement that the bidder deliver to the target and any other bidder the first written communication relating to the transaction that is filed, or required to be filed, with the Commission.<sup> 112 </sup> This material must be delivered on the date of the communication.<sup> 113 </sup><h>E. Exchange Offers May Commence On Filing4. Early Commencement </h><h>4. Early Commencement </h>

We are adopting the early commencement provision substantially as proposed, but extended to cover issuer exchange offers. Currently, registered exchange offers may not commence until the related registration statement becomes effective.<sup> 114 </sup> As we noted in the Proposing Release, this results in cash and stock tender offers being treated differently. Cash tender offers have a distinct timing advantage over stock tender offers because cash offers can commence as soon as a tender offer statement is filed and disseminated.<sup> 115 </sup> This change should minimize this regulatory disparity by permitting stock tender offers to commence as early as the date the related registration statement is first filed.

Almost all of the commenters that addressed early commencement indicated that it was a step in the right direction, but they believed more was needed to fully balance the regulation of cash and stock offers. We recognized in the Proposing Release that early commencement alone may not be sufficient to level the playing field between cash and stock tender offers because bidders would not be able to purchase shares tendered in the offer until after the related registration statement is effective. Accordingly, cash offers could close earlier than stock tender offers due to possible staff review and comment on the registration statement. We solicited comment on whether there are other changes ( e.g. , expedited staff review, automatic effectiveness on filing or effectiveness within a specified time after filing), that might further reduce the disparity in regulatory treatment. We also asked whether expedited staff review would minimize the regulatory differences.

Commenters had mixed views. Some commenters favored automatic effectiveness or effectiveness shortly after filing, while others believed the potential for post-effective staff review and comment would discourage bidders from offering securities as consideration in a tender offer.<sup> 116 </sup> Most commenters, however, were in agreement that expedited staff review is essential to balancing the regulatory treatment of the two types of offers. Due to the risks associated with automatic effectiveness and effectiveness shortly after filing (before the staff has had an adequate opportunity to review the disclosure), we believe these measures would not be in security holders' best interests, especially in the business combination context where the disclosure and accounting issues can be particularly complex. We are, however, committed to expediting staff review of exchange offers so that they may compete more effectively with cash tender offers.

As proposed, early commencement was limited to third-party offers. We solicited comment, however, on whether early commencement would provide any benefits to issuers making exchange offers for their own securities. Several of the commenters believed that issuers should have the same ability to commence an exchange offer upon filing.<sup> 117 </sup> We agree that there is no reason to exclude issuer exchange offers from early commencement, and therefore, we have decided to treat third-party and issuer exchange offers alike under the new rule.

We also asked whether there should be a proxy analogue to early commencement so that parties to a business combination transaction involving a voting decision would be able to furnish proxy cards with preliminary proxy materials. Currently, proxy cards may only accompany the definitive proxy statement/prospectus.<sup> 118 </sup> A proxy analogue would further balance the regulatory treatment of mergers and tender offers.

We are not adopting a proxy analogue to early commencement at this time. We note that all tender offers must remain open for at least 20 business days.<sup> 119 </sup> Currently, the minimum proxy solicitation period is dictated by applicable state corporate law requirements.<sup> 120 </sup> A proxy solicitation period, accordingly, could be less than 20 business days. Further, under the new rules adopted today, we are specifying the appropriate time periods necessary for dissemination of a prospectus supplement when there are material changes to the information previously disseminated. The proxy rules do not have similar provisions. Since the proxy solicitation area has traditionally been governed by state law, and because we are not adopting a federally mandated proxy solicitation period,<sup> 121 </sup> we are not adopting an analogue to early commencement that would permit the sending of proxy cards along with preliminary proxy materials. We may consider extending the concept to the solicitation of proxies once we have sufficient experience with early commencement of exchange offers. Any proxy analogue to early commencement would, of course, require the establishment of a uniform proxy solicitation period and well-defined time periods for the dissemination and receipt of a supplement containing all material changes from the preliminary proxy statement previously sent or given to security holders.<sup> 122 </sup>

Under the new rules,<sup> 123 </sup> to commence an exchange offer early (before effectiveness of a registration statement), a bidder must file a registration statement relating to the securities offered and include in the preliminary prospectus all information, including pricing information,<sup> 124 </sup> necessary for investors to make an informed investment decision.<sup> 125 </sup> Information may not be omitted under Rule 430 or Rule 430A under the Securities Act.<sup> 126 </sup> Bidders also must disseminate the prospectus and related letter of transmittal to all security holders and file a tender offer statement with us before the exchange offer can commence.<sup> 127 </sup> Early commencement is at the option of the bidder. Exchange offers can commence as early as the filing of a registration statement, or on a later date selected by the bidder up to the date of effectiveness.<sup> 128 </sup> If a bidder does not commence its exchange offer before effectiveness of the related registration statement, then the exchange offer would need to commence on or shortly after effectiveness, as is the case today.

As proposed, we are adopting new Rule 162 to permit the tender of securities into an exchange offer before a registration statement is effective.<sup> 129 </sup> New Rule 162(a) exempts the tender of securities from Section 5(a) of the Securities Act.<sup> 130 </sup> Security holders may withdraw tendered securities until they are purchased, and bidders may not purchase the tendered securities until the registration statement is declared effective, as is currently the case. Because security holders must receive a mandated disclosure document before having to make an investment decision, we believe that early commencement, together with the communications scheme adopted today, is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Early commencement gives bidders an incentive to disseminate their offering materials broadly to all security holders as soon as practicable. Further, the new rule provides bidders with greater flexibility in choosing the form of consideration to offer in a business combination transaction and should serve to facilitate the growth of our capital markets.<h>2. Dissemination of a Supplement and Extension of the Offer </h>

Under the early commencement provision adopted, bidders are required to disseminate a prospectus to all security holders. If a bidder wants to commence its exchange offer early, it must disseminate a preliminary prospectus to all security holders as discussed above. The new rules also provide that bidders sending a preliminary prospectus must disseminate a supplement to security holders if there are any material changes, whether as a result of staff review, or due to any other material changes in the information previously disclosed. Exchange offers must remain open for a specified minimum period of time after a supplement is sent to security holders containing the new information, depending on the significance of the change. This is to permit security holders to react to the information by tendering securities or by withdrawing securities already tendered.

Since the tender offer rules do not currently establish specific minimum time periods necessary for the disclosure and dissemination of material changes, other than those relating to changes in price or the amount of securities sought,<sup> 131 </sup> we are establishing well-defined periods necessary for the dissemination of a prospectus supplement that contains material changes under early commencement. The mandated periods we adopt today are consistent with our current rules and interpretive positions in this area.<sup> 132 </sup> Therefore, we are revising Rule 14d-4 to specify the minimum time periods necessary for the dissemination of changes to preliminary prospectuses that are used to commence an exchange offer early.<sup> 133 </sup> As a result, exchange offers that commence early must remain open for at least:

 

five business days for a prospectus supplement containing a material change other than price or share levels;

ten business days for a prospectus supplement containing a change in price, the number of shares sought, the dealer's soliciting fee, or other similarly significant change;

ten business days for a prospectus supplement included as part of a post-effective amendment; and

20 business days for a revised prospectus when the initial prospectus was materially deficient; for example, failing to comply with the going-private rules or filing a "shell" document solely to trigger commencement and staff review. <sup> 134 </sup> 

Of course, if a material change in the information previously disseminated to security holders occurred shortly before the expiration of the offer, a prospectus supplement would need to be disseminated to security holders and the offer extended for the appropriate length of time. We also believe that these time periods represent general guidelines that should be applied uniformly to all tender offers, including those subject only to Regulation 14E.<sup> 135 </sup>

We asked whether bidders should be required to deliver a final prospectus to security holders. Commenters who addressed the issue believed that the requirement to deliver prospectus supplements containing all material changes should effectively eliminate the need for the dissemination of a final prospectus. We agree that the informational purpose of the prospectus may best be served by requiring bidders to deliver to security holders prospectus supplements containing material changes rather than redeliver a final prospectus repeating substantial amounts of information that was previously delivered.<sup> 136 </sup> The use of prospectus supplements should adequately inform security holders of the information they need to make an informed investment decision.

Accordingly, we are using our exemptive authority<sup> 137 </sup> to exempt exchange offers that commence early from the final prospectus delivery requirement.<sup> 138 </sup> In doing so, we are not changing the final prospectus delivery requirement in Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(d).<sup> 139 </sup> Under these circumstances, where a preliminary prospectus is delivered to security holders along with prospectus supplements containing material changes to the information previously disseminated, we believe that the cost of delivering a final prospectus is not justified by any marginal benefit to security holders. Although we are eliminating the requirement to deliver a final prospectus, bidders would still need to file a final prospectus.<h>F. Disclosure Requirements for Tender Offers and Mergers1. Schedules Combined and Disclosure Requirements Moved to Subpart 1000 of Regulation S-K ("Regulation M-A") </h><h>1. Schedules Combined and Disclosure Requirements Moved to Subpart 1000 of Regulation S-K ("Regulation M-A") </h>

Currently, there are different disclosure schedules for issuer tender offers, third-party tender offers and going-private transactions.<sup> 140 </sup> Since a given transaction may involve more than one of these regulatory schemes, a company may be required to file a separate disclosure document to satisfy each applicable disclosure regime. In addition, the disclosure requirements appearing in the rules and schedules can often lead to duplicative, and sometimes inconsistent, requirements. In light of the increased pressure to announce a business combination transaction soon after it is entered into and the attendant requirement to file mandated disclosure documents quickly, we proposed to integrate, simplify and update the disclosure requirements currently in the rules and schedules. Our basic approach was to combine all the disclosure requirements in one central location in a subpart of Regulation S-K, called Regulation M-A. The specific disclosure requirements in schedules were keyed to items under Regulation M-A in a manner consistent with the integrated disclosure system previously adopted for proxy and registration statements.

All commenters addressing the proposed changes in this area believed that it was time to update and simplify the disclosure requirements for business combination transactions.<sup> 141 </sup> We are adopting Regulation M-A substantially as proposed. This series of disclosure items incorporates all the current disclosure requirements for issuer and third-party tender offers, tender offer recommendation statements and going-private transactions. The new regulation includes some disclosure items for cash merger proxy statements as well. We have made slight modifications, where necessary, to harmonize and clarify the requirements, as well as a few substantive changes that are discussed below in more detail. In some cases the disclosure requirements may appear different, but that is because we have made an effort to draft the items in Regulation M-A using clear, plain language. In the future, we expect to expand this new regulation to cover additional disclosure items as necessary.

We are combining current Schedules 13E-4 and 14D-1 (the schedules now used for issuer and third-party tender offers, respectively), into new Schedule TO, as proposed.<sup> 142 </sup> In addition, we are changing the rules to allow one filing to satisfy both the tender offer and going-private disclosure requirements.<sup> 143 </sup> As a result, the information required by Schedules 14D-1, 13E-4 and 13E-3 can be disclosed in one combined filing.<sup> 144 </sup> We believe that these revisions will reduce the need to file two or more schedules for what is essentially the same transaction.<sup> 145 </sup>

We have included an instruction in new Schedule TO, as proposed, listing the specific line items that must be complied with for different types of transactions.<sup> 146 </sup> In addition, we have revised the current instruction requiring information that is incorporated by reference to be filed as an exhibit. As revised, filers can incorporate information included in documents previously filed electronically on EDGAR without refiling that information as an exhibit to the schedule.<sup> 147 </sup> To the extent that the existing schedules permit filers to include negative answers in the schedule, but not in the disclosure document sent to security holders, filers will continue to have the ability to omit that information from documents sent to security holders.<sup> 148 </sup>

At this time we are not extending the one filing satisfies all approach to encompass transactions involving the Securities Act and proxy rules as well as the tender offer and going-private rules. In the future, we may consider integrating the requirements further, to permit the satisfaction of the disclosure required under all four regulatory schemes with one filing.

We also are revising the rules that require filing persons to include a fair and adequate summary of the information required by the schedules in the disclosure document sent to security holders. Instead of specifying some items and excluding others, as the current rules do,<sup> 149 </sup> the revised rules simply require that the document given to security holders summarize all items in the schedule (except for exhibits).<sup> 150 </sup> As noted in the Proposing Release, this change is not intended to increase the amount of information that is given to security holders. Instead, it is intended to simplify the requirements. We expect filers to exercise their judgment in determining the specific information that must be included in the disclosure document sent to security holders to provide a fair and adequate summary. We are not, however, changing the current requirement that certain disclosure required in a going-private transaction be set forth in full in the disclosure document delivered to security holders.<sup> 151 </sup>

As a result of today's changes, filers no longer need to answer each item of the schedule with a statement that the required information is incorporated by reference from certain pages or sections of the primary disclosure document. Under the revised rules, it is sufficient to include a general statement in the schedule that all information in the disclosure document filed as an exhibit is incorporated by reference in answer to all or some of the items in the schedule. The revised schedules, as proposed, would include a cover page, any exhibits and the required signatures. Specific item numbers from the schedule must be included only to the extent necessary to provide information that is not in the disclosure document sent to security holders, but is required to be disclosed under an item in the schedule.<sup> 152 </sup> This change is designed to make the schedules easier to prepare. Of course, filers still must provide all the required information.<sup> 153 </sup><h>2. Streamline and Improve Required Disclosure </h>

a. "Plain English" Summary Term Sheet

We proposed to require a plain English summary term sheet in all cash tender offers and all cash mergers, as well as going-private transactions. The disclosure documents in these transactions often can be difficult to understand, especially in the context of a business combination transaction where a vast amount of information may be available. We believe security holders should be provided with a concise, easy to read term sheet that highlights the most important and relevant information regarding an extraordinary transaction.

Accordingly, we are adopting the plain English summary term sheet requirement as proposed.<sup> 154 </sup> We are not adopting a plain English summary term sheet for transactions involving the registration of securities<sup> 155 </sup> because these transactions already are required to have a plain English summary, although the format may be somewhat different from the summary term sheet approach.<sup> 156 </sup> The summary term sheet must begin on the first or second page of the disclosure document, and must highlight the most important or material features of a proposed transaction.<sup> 157 </sup> This requirement applies to all issuer and third-party cash tender offers, cash mergers and going-private transactions. We believe the disclosure in these transactions can be improved through the use of a plain English summary term sheet.

In proposing this requirement, we did not mandate the specific items or questions that must be addressed in every case. Instead, we gave examples of information that most security holders would need when confronted with a tender offer or merger. Most commenters favored the proposed approach of keeping the requirement general and giving filers the flexibility to determine the issues that rise to the level of addressing in a plain English summary term sheet. We are adopting this approach.

As noted in the Proposing Release, in most cases, we believe bidders should address the following questions in the summary term sheet accompanying their cash tender offers:

 

Who is offering to buy my securities?

What are the classes and amounts of securities sought in the offer?

How much is the bidder offering to pay and what is the form of payment?

Does the bidder have the financial resources to make payment?

Is the bidder's financial condition relevant to my decision on whether to tender in the offer?

How long do I have to decide whether to tender in the offer?

Can the offer be extended, and under what circumstances?

How will I be notified if the offer is extended?

What are the most significant conditions to the offer?

How do I tender my shares?

Until what time can I withdraw previously tendered shares?

How do I withdraw previously tendered shares?

If the transaction is negotiated, what does my board of directors think of the offer?

Is this the first step in a going-private transaction?

Will the tender offer be followed by a merger if all the company's shares are not tendered in the offer?

If I decide not to tender, how will the offer affect my shares?

What is the market value (if traded) or the net asset or liquidation value (if not traded) of my shares as of a recent date?

Who can I talk to if I have questions about the tender offer? 

As for merger proxy statements, we believe a summary term sheet should provide a brief outline of the particular matters proposed, the material terms of the proposals, including the parties to the proposed transaction, the consideration to be received by security holders, the board's recommendation on how to vote or their position regarding the transaction, the effect of a vote for and against each matter presented, including the effects of not voting, the procedures for voting and changing or revoking a vote, and the existence of appraisal rights.

Several commenters provided useful suggestions on other information that may assist security holders. We agree with these commenters that a plain English summary term sheet should address, to the extent applicable, the vote required to approve each matter presented, the number of votes, if any, already committed to vote in a particular way, any material interests of insiders or affiliates, as well as the accounting and federal income tax treatment of the transaction. In the context of a going-private transaction, we believe that the receipt of opinions, appraisals, or other similar reports<sup> 158 </sup> regarding the fairness of a transaction would be of material interest to security holders. In addition, the identity of the filing persons, including the affiliates engaged in the transaction, a description of their affiliation or relationship with the issuer, and their role in the transaction may be important disclosure. Of course, we do not attempt to provide an exhaustive list in this release of all the matters or issues that may be material to security holders warranting inclusion in a plain English summary term sheet. We leave that determination for filers based on the particular facts and circumstances of their transaction.

b. Item 14 of Schedule 14A Revised to Clarify Requirements and Harmonize Cash Merger and Cash Tender Offer Disclosure

Item 14 of Schedule 14A specifies the information required in proxy and information statements relating to extraordinary transactions.<sup> 159 </sup> We are revising Item 14 substantially as proposed, except that the revised item refers filers to the applicable disclosure requirements in Forms S-4 and F-4, instead of Forms C and SB-3, which are not being adopted at this time. This approach should make the item easier to understand, and harmonize the proxy and registration statement disclosure requirements. Since the disclosure and incorporation by reference requirements in Forms S-4 and F-4 are essentially the same as in current Item 14, this streamlined approach will not greatly modify the disclosure required in a merger proxy statement. We are retaining in Item 14 the existing disclosure requirements applicable to investment companies.<sup> 160 </sup>

In addition, we are adopting several substantive changes regarding the information required for acquirors and targets under Item 14. All commenters that addressed the proposed changes to Item 14 believed they were appropriate. We continue to believe that in certain circumstances the disclosure requirements in Item 14 may be unnecessarily burdensome and inconsistent with the level of information that would be required if the same transaction was structured as an all-cash, all-share tender offer. Therefore, we are adopting the following proposed revisions:

 

Item 14 is revised to clarify that financial statement and other information about the acquiror is required in a cash merger only if that information is material to voting security holders' evaluation of the transaction.<sup> 161 </sup> Similar to the need for a bidder's financial statements in a cash tender offer, information about the acquiror in a merger is generally not needed when target security holders are receiving cash and the acquiror has demonstrated its financial ability to satisfy the terms of the offer.<sup> 162 </sup>

In cases where financial statement information for the acquiror would be material to a security holder's voting decision, acquiror information is required for only two years and not three, consistent with the treatment of tender offers.<sup> 163 </sup>

The requirement to provide information about the target in a cash merger is eliminated when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction.<sup> 164 </sup> Most likely, target security holders will have information about the securities they already hold. As a result, security holders can receive a shorter disclosure document that is focused on the terms and effects of the transaction. This revision harmonizes the disclosure required in cash merger transactions with that required in all-cash, all-share tender offers. <sup> 165 </sup> 

The changes adopted today do not change the current requirement to provide financial statements of the target and other company information when the acquiror's security holders are voting on the transaction, since those security holders may not know anything about the target. In addition, target information is required in merger proxies that are going-private or roll-up transactions. We believe that target security holders have a need for current financial statements of their company if it is subject to one of these types of transactions.

We are not adopting two proposed changes. Under the proposal, Item 14 would no longer permit information to be incorporated by reference from the "glossy" annual report sent to security holders. Further, we proposed to eliminate the instructions in Schedule 14A and Form S-4 that require filers to send the mandated disclosure document to security holders at least 20 business days before the meeting date or the expiration date of an exchange offer if information is incorporated by reference.<sup> 166 </sup> At this time we believe there still may be a number of security holders that do not have the ability to access information electronically, so we are not eliminating the 20 business day incorporation by reference provision.<sup> 167 </sup> We are retaining incorporation by reference from the glossy annual report because this information is delivered to security holders.<sup> 168 </sup>

c. Reduced Financial Statement Requirements for Mergers and Stock Tender Offers

The previous section addressed information requirements in cash mergers. We also have examined financial statement requirements in the context of stock mergers and stock tender offers. As we noted in the Proposing Release, financial statements of the target generally are required when registered securities are being offered. The rules currently provide special treatment when the target is not subject to the Commission's reporting requirements, but we believe these requirements can be further relaxed. Currently, the rules require the filing person (the acquiror) to provide financial statements of the non-reporting target going back three years.<sup> 169 </sup> We noted that providing three years of financial statements prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X<sup> 170 </sup> for a non-reporting company can be costly and burdensome to prepare. In some cases they may not be available. Therefore, we proposed to reduce the financial statements required for non-reporting targets when the acquiror's security holders are not being asked to vote on the transaction.

Most commenters believed that the proposed reduction was appropriate and would facilitate acquisitions of non-reporting targets. We continue to believe that the requirement to provide target financial statements can be curtailed, particularly because in many cases target security holders likely made their initial investment decision in the non-reporting company based on less extensive information than what is currently required. In addition, security holders are being offered securities in a public company for which there should be significantly more information available and a more liquid market to sell into. Therefore, we are reducing the financial statement requirement substantially as proposed.<sup> 171 </sup> In addition, where the non-reporting target is not significant to the acquiror and the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction, we believe the financial statement requirements can be reduced even further.

Accordingly, we are eliminating the requirement to provide financial statements for the non-reporting target altogether when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction and the non-reporting target is not significant to the acquiror above the 20% level.<sup> 172 </sup> The security holders that purchased securities in the non-reporting company generally would be aware that they invested in a company that is not subject to our reporting requirements and they would not expect to receive the same level of financial information that is required for a public reporting company. Moreover, if the non-reporting company is not significant to the acquiror, we believe security holders would likely rely on the financial statements of the acquiror in making their voting or investment decision. Because a combination of an insignificant non-reporting target company and a public acquiror should not materially alter the financial condition of the acquiror, we believe that non-reporting target security holders are likely to rely on the required acquiror financial information alone.<sup> 173 </sup> In addition, the 20% threshold is the standard adopted in 1996 for the requirement of audited financial statements in filings made under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act for business acquisitions.<sup> 174 </sup>

Accordingly, we are revising the financial statement requirements for non-reporting targets when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction,<sup> 175 </sup> as follows:

 

If a non-reporting company is being acquired in a business combination transaction, then financial statements for the latest fiscal year prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") must be provided.<sup> 176 </sup>

Also, if the non-reporting target security holders were previously provided with GAAP financial statements for either or both of the two fiscal years before the latest fiscal year, then GAAP financial statements must be provided for those years as well.

If the non-reporting target is not significant to the acquiror in excess of the 20% level, then no financial information is required for the target.<sup> 177 </sup> 

These revisions apply equally to foreign and domestic non-reporting target companies. If the target's financial statements are prepared on the basis of a comprehensive body of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP (foreign GAAP), a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP is required unless a reconciliation is unavailable or not otherwise obtainable without unreasonable cost or expense.<sup> 178 </sup>

The current requirement to provide "audited" financial statements for the non-reporting target remains the same. Financial statements for the latest fiscal year must be audited only to the extent practicable. Audited financial statements are not required for years before the most recent fiscal year if the target's financial statements were not previously audited.

We are not changing the current requirement that a resale registration statement include audited financial statements in accordance with Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X.<sup> 179 </sup> Also, to the extent that a transaction is significant to the acquiror, audited financial statements would ultimately need to be provided under Item 7 of Form 8-K. Of course, if the acquiror's security holders are voting on the transaction, then the current financial statement requirements apply.<h>G. Tender Offer Rules Updated </h>

In addition to the changes discussed above, some of which affect tender offers, we proposed to update the tender offer rules, which have not been revised since 1986. For the most part, commenters favored our approach to updating the regulations. As a result, these changes are being adopted, substantially as proposed.<sup> 180 </sup> The significant changes are discussed below.

We also solicited comment on whether the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA") safe harbor for forward-looking statements should be extended to tender offers. We are not extending the PSLRA safe harbor to tender offers at this time. Given the relative infancy of the body of law interpreting the PSLRA generally and the safe harbor in particular, we do not believe that extending the reach of the safe harbor would be prudent. We note, for example, that we recently filed an amicus curiae brief out of concern about certain language in an appellate court decision regarding the application of the safe harbor.<sup> 181 </sup><h>1. Bidders May Include a "Subsequent Offering Period" Without Withdrawal Rights </h>

We are adopting the subsequent offering period rule with several modifications described below. Under the new rules third-party bidders may provide, at their election, a subsequent offering period during which security holders can tender securities into the offer without withdrawal rights. The purpose of the subsequent offering period is two-fold. First, the period will assist bidders in reaching the statutory state law minimum necessary to engage in a short-form, back-end merger with the target. Second, the period will provide security holders who remain after the offer one last opportunity to tender into an offer that is otherwise complete in order to avoid the delay and illiquid market that can result after a tender offer and before a back-end merger.

The subsequent offering period may be disclosed in the bidder's initial offering materials, or in a subsequent amendment to the tender offer materials that is disseminated to security holders. In either case, the bidder's determination to include a subsequent offering period must be disclosed sufficiently in advance of the expiration of the initial offering period.

Commenters generally were favorable to the proposal, but many commenters criticized the advance notice requirement. They expressed the view that advance notice would create a "hold-out" problem with security holders waiting until the subsequent offering period to tender shares. In response to these comments, we are not adopting a specific requirement in the rule that the determination to add a subsequent offering period must be disclosed before the end of the initial offering period. Nevertheless, we continue to believe at this time that the addition of a subsequent offering period once an offer has commenced would constitute a material change to the terms of that offer. Thus, bidders must disseminate the new information to security holders in a manner reasonably calculated to inform them of the change sufficiently in advance of the expiration of the initial offering period (generally five business days).<sup> 182 </sup> After the Division of Corporation Finance gains practical experience with the operation of the subsequent offering period, the Division may decide, through staff interpretation, to shorten or possibly eliminate the requirement for advance notice.<sup> 183 </sup>

In short, we are adopting new Rule 14d-11, which permits bidders to include a subsequent offering period in a third-party tender offer during which no withdrawal rights are available,<sup> 184 </sup> so long as:

 

the offer is for all outstanding securities of the class sought;

the initial offering period (with withdrawal rights) remains open for at least 20 business days;

 all conditions to the offer are deemed satisfied or waived by the bidder on or before the close of the initial offering period;<sup> 185 </sup>

the bidder accepts and promptly pays for all securities tendered during the initial offering period on the closing of the initial offering period;

the bidder announces the approximate number and percentage of outstanding securities that were deposited by the close of the initial offering period no later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day after the scheduled expiration date of the initial offering period; and

the bidder immediately accepts and promptly pays for all shares as they are tendered in the subsequent offering period. <sup> 186 </sup> 

The rule, as proposed and adopted, permits bidders to use a subsequent offering period in both cash and stock tender offers.<sup> 187 </sup> Similarly, the rule permits bidders to offer either cash or stock in any planned back-end merger. There is no specific requirement that a minimum number of shares be tendered in the initial offering period. Of course, the same consideration must be paid in both the initial and subsequent offering periods.<sup> 188 </sup>

The new rule includes a requirement that bidders announce the results of the initial offering period (including the number and percentage of securities tendered) before 9:00 a.m. on the next business day following the close of the initial offering period.<sup> 189 </sup> We believe an announcement is necessary to inform remaining security holders whether the offer was successful and whether or not a back-end merger is imminent. Because of this requirement to announce the results before 9:00 a.m. on the next business day, the subsequent offering period must begin on that day. This will avoid any delay in the offer between the initial offering period and the subsequent offering period. We believe that this will prevent any confusion in the market as to whether the offering period is still open.

We proposed conditioning the subsequent offering period on the bidder stating its intention to engage in a back-end merger with the target. Commenters addressing this issue did not believe that this requirement was necessary. We are not adopting this requirement because we believe security holders may benefit from a subsequent offering period whether or not the bidder intends a back-end merger transaction.

As proposed, Rule 14d-1(e)(8) would have defined the subsequent offering period as a ten business day period following the initial offering period. Several commenters, however, recommended that bidders be permitted to determine the duration of the subsequent offering period. In response to these comments, we have decided to adopt a more flexible approach to the subsequent offering period. New Rule 14d-11 will allow the subsequent offering period to be a minimum of three business days and a maximum of 20 business days. Bidders could opt for a relatively short subsequent offering period and later extend the period if necessary. Any extension of the subsequent offering period must be made in accordance with Rule 14e-1(d).<sup> 190 </sup><h>2. Bidder Financial Information Clarified for Cash Tender Offers </h>

a. When a Bidder's Financial Statements Are Not Required; Source of Funds

We are clarifying when financial statement information of the bidder must be disclosed in a cash tender offer.<sup> 191 </sup> Currently, this information is required in a cash tender offer when the information is material to a security holder's decision whether to tender, sell or hold.<sup> 192 </sup> The instructions in Schedule 14D-1 provide some guidance on when financial statement information is material.<sup> 193 </sup> These instructions also specify the type of information that will satisfy the financial statement disclosure requirement.<sup> 194 </sup>

We noted in the Proposing Release that generally there are several factors that should be considered in determining whether financial statements of the bidder are material. Those factors are as follows:

 

the terms of the tender offer, particularly terms concerning the amount of securities sought, such as any-or-all, a fixed minimum with the right to accept additional shares tendered, all-or-none, and a fixed percentage of the outstanding;

whether the purpose of the tender offer is for control of the subject company;<sup> 195 </sup>

the plans or proposals of the bidder; and

the ability of the bidder to pay for the securities sought in the tender offer and/or to repay any loans made by the bidder or its affiliates in connection with the tender offer or otherwise. <sup> 196 </sup> 

We also noted that these factors are not exclusive, and not all factors are necessary to meet the materiality test. In order to provide more guidance to bidders, we are adopting a new instruction to Schedule TO specifying when the financial statements of a bidder are not material and do not have to be provided. Commenters generally supported the proposal, offering some suggestions on how to modify the instruction so that it achieves its intended purpose. We are, therefore, adopting the instruction with some minor changes. We believe that under the circumstances specified in the new instruction, the burden of providing the bidder's financial information in tender offer materials may outweigh the usefulness of the information to security holders.<sup> 197 </sup>

As adopted, Item 10 to new Schedule TO<sup> 198 </sup> includes an instruction stating that a bidder's financial statement information is not material when:

 

only cash consideration is offered;

the offer is not subject to any financing condition; and either :

the bidder is a public reporting company that files reports electronically on EDGAR; or 

the offer is for all outstanding securities of the target. <sup> 199 </sup> 

Several commenters addressed the financing condition element to the instruction. Most of these commenters indicated that the status of a bidder's financing arrangements ( e.g. , commitment letter, definitive financing in place, or sufficient funds on hand) is not determinative so long as the offer is not subject to a financing condition. We agree. We believe security holders may need financial information for the bidder when an offer is subject to a financing condition so they can evaluate the terms of the offer, gauge the likelihood of the offer's success and make an informed investment decision. Whether an offer is conditioned on obtaining satisfactory financing arrangements ( e.g. , receipt of a commitment letter or execution of other definitive financing documents) or the actual receipt of funds from a lender,<sup> 200 </sup> the offer is considered subject to a financing condition and the bidder may not omit financial information in reliance on the instruction.

We also asked whether foreign companies whose financial statement information may not be readily available should be treated any differently. Foreign companies are permitted to file reports in paper and are not required to file electronically.<sup> 201 </sup> As a result, security holders may have more difficulty obtaining information for foreign bidders. Two commenters indicated that foreign bidders that file reports ( e.g. , Form 20-F)<sup> 202 </sup> in paper should not be able to satisfy the third prong of the instruction. We agree that the instruction should take into account the availability of financial statement information for foreign bidders. If information is available on EDGAR (via the Internet and other sources), we believe there is less need to require disclosure of the bidder's financial statements in its tender offer materials. Therefore, we have revised this condition to state that the bidder must be a reporting company that files reports electronically on EDGAR.<sup> 203 </sup> Of course, foreign bidders that choose to file reports electronically on EDGAR can rely fully on this new instruction. Alternatively, a bidder that is non-reporting or files reports in paper may rely on the instruction if the offer is for all outstanding securities of the target.<sup> 204 </sup>

We also proposed to codify the current practice of providing net worth information when the bidder is a natural person. The one commenter that addressed this proposal supported it, but believed the requirement to provide "appropriate disclosure" when a bidder's net worth is derived from material amounts of assets that are not readily marketable or there are material guarantees and contingencies was too vague. Therefore, we are adopting this instruction, substantially as proposed, but with a clarification that the bidder must disclose the nature and approximate amount of the individual's net worth consisting of illiquid assets and the magnitude of any guarantees or contingencies that may negatively affect the natural person's net worth.<sup> 205 </sup> We believe this information is useful to security holders in evaluating a tender offer made by a natural person.

Regardless of the level of financial information that security holders receive, a bidder's ability to pay for the securities is a material disclosure item. We believe the disclosure that security holders currently receive in this area can be improved by clarifying the "Source of Funds" item requirement for tender offers and going-private transactions. As proposed, we are revising this item to require disclosure of information regarding the specific sources of financing, any conditions to the financing, and the filing person's ability to finance the transaction through alternative means if the primary source of financing should fall through.<sup> 206 </sup>

b. Content of Bidder's Financial Statements in Cash Tender Offers; Financial Statements in Going-Private Transactions

In the Proposing Release we noted the disparity in the financial statements required in third-party tender offers, issuer tender offers, and going-private transactions. We are reducing the financial statement information required in third-party tender offers as proposed. This change harmonizes the requirements with those for issuer tender offers and going-private transactions.<sup> 207 </sup> The commenters that addressed this proposal supported it. We believe that the burden of providing three years of historical financial statements in a third-party cash tender offer outweighs the benefit to security holders.<sup> 208 </sup>

We also proposed to update the disclosure requirements for tender offers and going-private transactions. Currently, information regarding book value per share and the pro forma effect of the transaction on the company's balance sheet and book value per share (as of the most recent fiscal year end and the latest interim balance sheet period) may be required. We are reducing the required information, as proposed, to only the most recent balance sheet date.<sup> 209 </sup>

In addition, when financial statement information is required in tender offer and going-private transactions, the current rules permit filers to include summary financial information,<sup> 210 </sup> instead of full financial statements, in the disclosure documents sent to security holders. We proposed to update the summary information requirements to consist of the summarized financial information specified in Rule 1-02(bb) of Regulation S-X<sup> 211 </sup> as well as ratio of earnings to fixed charges, book value per share and pro forma data. The two commenters that addressed this proposal indicated that the additional information (redeemable preferred stock, minority interests, unconsolidated subsidiaries and 50 percent or less owned persons) called for by Rule 1-02(bb) is not relevant or useful to security holders, especially in cash tender offers.

In response to their concern, we have revised the summary requirement so that information regarding unconsolidated subsidiaries and 50 percent or less owned persons is not required. We continue to believe, however, that the information specified in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) (redeemable preferred stock and minority interests) may be relevant when the bidder's financial information is material<sup> 212 </sup> and the bidder elects to provide summary instead of full financial statements in the disclosure document sent to security holders. Under the current rules a fair and adequate summary includes "shareholders' equity." The additional specificity provided by Rule 1-02(bb)(1) is not inconsistent with the current requirements. Also, information regarding the existence of minority interests may be material to security holders if the filing person (bidder) holds substantial assets or derives substantial revenues from a consolidated subsidiary that is not wholly-owned. Accordingly, we do not believe that updating the disclosure requirements to reference the information specified in Rule 1-02(bb)(1) will result in the disclosure of irrelevant information. As this information may be material to security holders, we adopt an updated definition of summary financial information that is substantially as proposed.<sup> 213 </sup> These revisions also extend to third-party tender offers the requirement to disclose book value information when that information is material.<sup> 214 </sup>

We also proposed to clarify the reconciliation required when non-U.S. GAAP financial statement information is summarized in a foreign bidder's disclosure document. We believe that summary financial information must include a reconciliation to the same extent full financial statements must include a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.<sup> 215 </sup> This reconciliation requirement is consistent with that required for the acquisition of a foreign non-reporting target company with foreign GAAP financial statements.<sup> 216 </sup>

c. Pro Forma Financial Information Required in Two-Tier Transactions

We believe security holders need pro forma financial information for a bidder and target on a combined basis when deciding whether or not to tender in the first tier of a two-tier transaction.<sup> 217 </sup> Security holders need pro forma financial information to make an informed investment decision because if security holders do not tender in an offer they may receive securities of the bidder in exchange for the securities they hold in the target at a later date in a back-end securities transaction. Bidders frequently disclose information regarding expected synergies and other financial information to effectively sell their transaction to the market. We believe that pro forma information may be necessary to balance the disclosure disseminated to security holders and the markets. In addition, disclosure of pro forma financial information is generally consistent with our free communications scheme.<sup> 218 </sup> We are, however, adopting a slightly less burdensome pro forma requirement than proposed in response to some of the concerns expressed by commenters.<sup> 219 </sup>

Three commenters generally supported the proposed pro forma requirement, expressing different views on the appropriate level of pro forma financial information and the circumstances under which the information should be required. Two commenters believed that the pro forma requirement would be burdensome and provide only a marginal benefit to security holders. Several commenters noted that external factors may affect a bidder's ability to prepare pro forma financial information in compliance with the proposed requirement. Some of these factors include: the lack of any agreement with the target regarding the type and amount of consideration to be offered to security holders in any back-end securities transaction; the hostile or negotiated nature of the transaction; and the results of the tender offer.

We recognize that it may be more difficult for bidders to prepare accurate and complete pro forma financial information when the target is not cooperating with the bidder. We also realize that bidders may decide later not to offer securities in a back-end transaction for a number of reasons. Nevertheless, to the extent that a bidder, at the time of the cash tender offer, intends to offer securities in a back-end securities transaction with the target, we believe such information would be material to target security holders.<sup> 220 </sup> In addition, bidders that intend to offer securities in a back-end transaction would most likely have prepared some level of pro forma financial information on the combined entity for their own negotiating and planning purposes. As a result, we do not believe the requirement to provide pro forma financial information should be unduly burdensome for the bidder. Therefore, we are adopting a requirement that bidders disclose pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, in addition to historical financial statements,<sup> 221 </sup> when they intend to engage in a back-end securities transaction following a cash tender offer.<sup> 222 </sup> We limit this requirement, however, in two important respects.

First, the requirement is limited to "negotiated" transactions ( i.e. , management of the target is cooperating with the bidder). Generally, in negotiated transactions, bidders have access to internal financial information of the target necessary to prepare pro forma financial information.<sup> 223 </sup> In transactions where the bidder does not have access to the internal information necessary to prepare reliable pro forma financial information in compliance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X ( i.e. , non-negotiated transactions), we are not requiring pro forma financial information. However, we encourage bidders to provide pro forma or other similar financial information that they consider useful and meaningful to security holders, regardless of whether the transaction is negotiated or not. Second, if an acquisition of a target is not significant to the bidder, we do not believe that pro forma financial information for the transaction would be helpful to security holders. Therefore, we are only requiring bidders to disclose pro forma financial information in a first-step tender offer when the acquisition is significant above the 20% level.<sup> 224 </sup><h>3. Target Is Required to Report Purchases of Its Own Securities After a Third-Party Tender Offer Is Commenced </h>

Rule 13e-1 prohibits an issuer whose securities are the subject of a third-party tender offer from repurchasing any of its equity securities until information about the intended acquisition is filed and disseminated to security holders. We proposed to clarify the timing of the disclosure called for by the rule so that the required information is disclosed only after a third-party tender offer is made, when it is most relevant. We also proposed to rewrite the rule in plain English. We are now adopting the revised rule as proposed, but without a requirement to send information to security holders. We also provide an exclusion from the rule for periodic repurchases in connection with employee benefit plans and other similar plans that are made in the ordinary course and not in response to the third-party offer.

Several commenters suggested that we rescind Rule 13e-1 based on the relatively low number of filings received during the past several years. Although few filings are made under the rule,<sup> 225 </sup> we continue to believe that the requirement serves the useful purpose of informing the marketplace in advance that an issuer plans to repurchase its own equity securities in response to a third party tender offer. While some of the information required by the rule may be provided in Schedule 14D-9, that schedule could be filed as late as ten business days after commencement of a third-party offer. Therefore, we are adopting the rule substantially as proposed, but as a filing requirement only. The information would not be required to be sent to security holders.<sup> 226 </sup> This will eliminate the cost to issuers of mailing the information, but the information will be publicly available to the marketplace.<h>4. Tender Offer and Proxy Rules Relating to the Delivery of a Security Holder List and Security Position Listing Harmonized </h>

We are adopting as proposed revisions to Rule 14d-5 to conform the tender offer dissemination requirements with the proxy dissemination requirements in Rule 14a-7.<sup> 227 </sup> The revised rule expands the scope of information included in a security holder list under the tender offer rules so that it is consistent with the security holder list requirements in the proxy rules. Under the revised rule, a target company that elects to provide a bidder with a security holder list instead of mailing the bidder's materials to security holders must disclose the most recent list of names, addresses and security positions of non-objecting beneficial owners (as well as record holders) it has in its possession, or subsequently obtains. The security holder list must be in the format requested by the bidder if it can be provided without undue burden or expense. The purpose of the amendment to the rule is to give bidders the same ability as target companies to communicate directly with non-objecting beneficial owners of securities.

Most commenters supported the proposal, with one commenter expressing concern on the mechanics of tracking transmittal letters. We do not believe that the revised rule would unduly complicate the tender process or the tracking of transmittal forms. Bidders would mail their tender offer materials to record holders, consistent with current practice, and record holders would then forward the materials to beneficial owners. Bidders also would have the option of supplementing their distribution by mailing directly to non-objecting beneficial owners set forth on the security holder list provided by the target. Transmittal forms would include instructions, as they do today, stating where to send transmittal forms ( e.g. , forms should be returned to the record holder with directions to tender shares in the offer).<h>5. New Rule 14e-5: Revision and Redesignation of Former Rule 10b-13, the Rule Prohibiting Purchases Outside an Offer </h>

Rule 10b-13 prohibits a person who is making a cash tender offer or exchange offer from purchasing or arranging to purchase, directly or indirectly, the security that is the subject of the offer (or any security that is immediately convertible into or exchangeable for the subject security), otherwise than as part of the offer. We proposed to clarify the rule's text, codify several interpretations and exemptions, and redesignate it as new Rule 14e-5. We are adopting the amendments substantially as proposed. In response to commenters' suggestions, we are adopting four additional exceptions. We also are implementing the changes proposed in the cross-border tender offers proposing release since those proposals are being adopted today.<sup> 228 </sup> With these two further exceptions regarding cross-border offers adopted today,<sup> 229 </sup> Rule 14e-5 has ten exceptions.

a. Redesignating Rule 10b-13 as Rule 14e-5

Former Rule 10b-13 is redesignated as Rule 14e-5. We originally promulgated Rule 10b-13 under Sections 10, 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act<sup> 230 </sup> to safeguard the interests of persons who sell their securities in response to a tender offer.<sup> 231 </sup> As stated in the Proposing Release, because the rule addresses conduct during tender offers, we believe it belongs with the other rules under Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act that address activities in the context of tender offers.<sup> 232 </sup> No commenters disagreed with this change, and we are adopting it as proposed.<sup> 233 </sup>

b. Clarification of Rule 14e-5; Prohibited Period

The amendments to Rule 14e-5 being adopted today do not alter the rule's basic terms. Instead, they modify the rule's text to more clearly set forth the covered activities. Rule 14e-5 will continue to protect investors by preventing an offeror from extending greater or different consideration to some security holders outside the offer, while other security holders are limited to the offer's terms.<sup> 234 </sup> <sup></sup>Rule 10b-13 prohibited a person who is making a cash tender offer or exchange offer from purchasing or arranging to purchase, directly or indirectly, the security that is the subject of the offer (or any security that is immediately convertible into or exchangeable for the subject security), otherwise than as part of the offer. Similarly, Rule 14e-5 prohibits a covered person from purchasing or arranging to purchase any subject securities or any related securities except as part of the tender offer. Rule 14e-5 does not explicitly include the term "exchange offer" as former Rule 10b-13 did because in Regulation 14E the term "tender offer" includes offers to exchange securities for cash and/or securities.<sup> 235 </sup>

We are changing the language describing the time period of the rule's restrictions. As adopted, the restrictions of Rule 14e-5 start upon "public announcement," which is defined in the rule as any oral or written communication by the offeror, or any person authorized to act on the offeror's behalf, that is reasonably designed to, or has the effect of, informing the public or security holders in general about the tender offer.<sup> 236 </sup> Although the language regarding the commencement of the rule's restrictions is different from the language in Rule 10b-13,<sup> 237 </sup> the scope is the same; the restrictions apply from the time holders of the subject securities, or the public more generally, are notified of the tender offer.<sup> 238 </sup>

We are adopting the proposed simplification of the language regarding the end of the rule's restrictions. Under Rule 14e-5, the restrictions end when the offer expires.<sup> 239 </sup> Under Rule 14d-11, a tender offer may be extended up to 20 days under specific circumstances without offering withdrawal rights,<sup> 240 </sup> thus giving security holders an additional opportunity to tender into the offer.

As adopted, Rule 14e-5 does not apply to purchases or arrangements to purchase outside of a tender offer during a subsequent offering period if the consideration is the same in form and amount. In the Proposing Release, we said we believed offeror purchases outside the offer during this subsequent offering period present the same concerns as during the initial offering period; therefore, we proposed that Rule 14e-5 restrictions would cover any subsequent offering period provided under proposed Rule 14d-11. Two commenters agreed with the proposal, and two others thought the rule should not extend to a subsequent offering period so long as the purchase price does not exceed the offer price. We now believe that the requirements of Rules 14d-11 and 14e-5 are sufficient to avoid any of the problems that Rule 14e-5 is designed to prevent. More specifically, under the terms of Rule 14e-5, any purchases made outside the offer during the subsequent offering period must be made using the same form and amount of consideration offered in the tender offer. Also, under the terms of Rule 14d-11, the offeror must immediately accept and promptly pay for all securities as they are tendered in the subsequent offering period, which eliminates any difference in the time value of money between those who tender and those who sell to the offeror outside the offer. Under these conditions, we believe those people who tender during a subsequent offering period will not be disadvantaged in relation to those whose securities are purchased outside of, but during, a subsequent offering period.

c. Persons and Securities Subject to the Rule 

 Scope of Persons Subject to the Rule 

Rule 10b-13 applied to the person who made the offer, which had been interpreted to cover the offeror, the offeror's affiliates, and the offer's dealer-manager.<sup> 241 </sup> Under Rule 14e-5, the Rule 10b-13 term "person" is replaced by "covered person" to codify this interpretation. The definition of "covered person" we are adopting has several changes from the proposed definition. The proposal defined a covered person as: the offeror and its affiliates; the offeror's dealer-manager(s) and other advisors; and any person acting, directly or indirectly, in concert with them. Two commenters objected to including all advisors within the meaning of covered person as too broad. We agree, and have narrowed the scope of the advisor category.

Covered person, as adopted, means: the offeror and its affiliates; the offeror's dealer-manager and its affiliates; any advisor to the offeror, dealer-manager or their affiliates, if such advisor's compensation is dependent on the completion of the offer; and any person acting, directly or indirectly, in concert with any of the other covered persons in connection with any purchase or arrangement to purchase any subject securities or any related securities.<sup> 242 </sup> These changes replace the broader proposed term "other advisors" with two narrower categories: affiliates of the dealer-manager; and advisors to the offeror, dealer-manager or their affiliates, if such advisor's compensation is dependent on the completion of the offer. These changes mean that advisors such as attorneys and accountants will not be affected by the rule where they have no stake in the outcome of the offer.

The proposed definition of an affiliate borrowed heavily from the definition in Rule 12b-2.<sup> 243 </sup> As proposed in Rule 14e-5, the term meant any person that "directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the offeror." The only distinction between the two definitions is that the proposed Rule 14e-5 definition was limited to affiliates of the offeror whereas, Rule 12b-2 extends to the affiliate of other relevant persons.<sup> 244 </sup> In order to accommodate other changes from proposed Rule 14e-5,<sup> 245 </sup> we needed to broaden this definition to include affiliates of the dealer-manager as well as the offeror, so we are adopting the entire definition of affiliate in Rule 12b-2.

 Scope of Securities Subject to the Rule 

We are adopting the proposed changes from Rule 10b-13 regarding the scope and treatment of related securities in the definitions of subject securities and related securities. Rule 14e-5 applies only to offers for equity securities, just as Rule 10b-13 did. Moreover, Rule 14e-5, as with Rule 10b-13, prohibits purchases outside the offer of not only the subject securities,<sup> 246 </sup> but also related securities. "Related securities" are defined as securities that are immediately convertible into, exchangeable for, or exercisable for subject securities. Among other things, this clarifies that securities that are immediately "exercisable for" subject securities, such as options, are included in the types of securities that a covered person cannot generally purchase outside the offer.

d. Excepted Transactions

 Exercise of Related Securities 

Rule 10b-13 specified that if the person making the offer "is the owner of another security which is immediately convertible into or exchangeable for the security which is the subject of the offer, his subsequent exercise of his right of conversion or exchange with respect to such other security shall not be prohibited by this rule." We are amending this provision as proposed.

When Rule 10b-13 was adopted, options were not nearly as common as they are today, and the text of this exception did not explicitly include the exercise of options. We believe the exercise of options acquired before announcement of the offer is no more likely to lead to undesirable effects than the exchange or conversion of other related securities, so we want to make it clear that the exercise of options is included in this exception. Thus, Rule 14e-5 will permit, as proposed, a covered person to convert, exchange, or exercise related securities, if the covered person owned the related securities before public announcement.

 Purchases by or for Plans 

The exception for purchases for plans is adopted as proposed. Since the adoption of Rule 10b-13, there has been an exception for purchases by the issuer of the target security (or a related security) under certain types of plans, by participating employees of the issuer or the employees of its subsidiaries, or by the trustee or other person acquiring the security for the account of the employees.<sup> 247 </sup> We are eliminating the references to outdated Internal Revenue Code provisions that were contained in Rule 10b-13 to define permissible plan purchases; instead, we are using the more expansive plan scope contained in the Commission's Regulation M. The exception now permits purchases of subject securities or related securities for any "plan" if the purchases are made by an "agent independent of the issuer" as these terms are defined in Regulation M.

 Purchases During Odd-Lot Offers 

We are adopting the proposed exception to permit purchases during an issuer odd-lot tender offer conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 13e-4(h)(5) under the Exchange Act.<sup> 248 </sup> This exception codifies a class exemption from Rule 10b-13 issued by the Commission in connection with a 1996 revision to Rule 13e-4(h)(5).<sup> 249 </sup> Under Rule

13e-4(h)(5), an issuer tender offer is excepted from application of Rule 13e-4 if the offer is directed solely to odd-lot security holders and provides "all holders" and "best price" protections to tendering security holders.

 Purchases as Intermediary 

We proposed to add an exception for unsolicited purchases by a dealer-manager that are made on an agency basis. We based this exception on a prior exemption<sup> 250 </sup> that allowed a dealer-manager to continue to conduct its customary brokerage (i.e., agent) activities during a tender offer. These activities generally do not raise the concerns that proposed Rule 14e-5 is intended to address. In the Proposing Release, we asked if the exception should permit "riskless principal" transactions by dealer-managers as well. Two commenters answered this question and both agreed that the exception should be broadened to permit unsolicited purchases as a riskless principal by dealer-managers. One of the two thought it should extend to other financial advisors.

As adopted, we are broadening this exception in two ways from the proposal. First, we are including affiliates of the dealer-manager within the exception. Second, in addition to agency transactions, we are permitting purchases to offset a contemporaneous sale after having received an unsolicited order in the ordinary course of business to buy from a customer who is not a covered person, if the dealer-manager or affiliate is not a market maker.<sup> 251 </sup> We believe these changes appropriately accommodate a dealer-manager's and its affiliates' activities as intermediary without allowing the offeror to use the dealer-manager and its affiliates to facilitate the tender offer.

e. Additional Exceptions Being Adopted

We are adopting four exceptions that were not proposed specifically, although we either sought comment in the Proposing Release or received suggestions from commenters on them.

 Purchases Pursuant to Contractual Obligations 

In the Proposing Release, we asked whether an offeror should be permitted to purchase subject or related securities outside an offer if a purchase contract was entered into before public announcement of the offer and the per share purchase price is no higher than the offer consideration. Four commenters addressed this issue, and all agreed such purchases should be permitted. One commenter stated that it could not discern any public policy rationale for permitting purchases pursuant to conversions, exchanges or exercises but not pre-announcement contracts. We agree with the commenters.

As adopted, this exception is available only if: the contract was entered into before public announcement; the contract is unconditional and binding on both parties; and the existence of the contract and all material terms, including quantity, price and parties, are disclosed in the offering materials.<sup> 252 </sup> We are not requiring that the contract price be the same as the offer price because we view these contracts as the functional equivalents of options that have no such price restriction for their exercise under Rule 14e-5.

 Basket Transactions 

In response to a commenter's suggestion, we are adopting an exception for transactions in baskets of securities containing a subject security or a related security.<sup> 253 </sup> We are requiring that: the purchase or arrangement to purchase the basket be made in the ordinary course of business and not to facilitate the offer; the basket contains 20 or more securities; and covered securities and related securities do not comprise more than 5% of the value of the basket.<sup> 254 </sup>

We believe that transactions in baskets, following the terms of this exception, provide little opportunity for a covered person to facilitate an offer or for a security holder to exact a premium from the offeror. Facilitation of an offer includes purchases intended to bid up the market price of the covered or related security, and includes buying a basket to strip out the covered security in an effort to get the offeror the number of shares it is seeking.

 Covering Transactions 

In response to a commenter's suggestion, we are adopting an exception from Rule 14e-5 for purchases of subject and related securities that are made to satisfy an obligation to deliver arising from a short sale or from the exercise of an option by a non-covered person. This exception is available to any covered person, so long as the short sale or option transaction was made in the ordinary course of business, not to facilitate the tender offer, and before public announcement. We adopt this exception because we believe such purchases effected for the purpose of making delivery to another party warrant the same treatment as purchases made pursuant to contractual obligations.

 Purchases by an Affiliate of the Dealer-Manager 

In response to a commenter's suggestion, we are adopting an exception from Rule 14e-5 for purchases of subject and related securities by an affiliate of the dealer-manager.<sup> 255 </sup> This exception permits purchases or arrangements to purchase by an affiliate of a dealer-manager if:

 

the dealer-manager maintains and enforces written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the flow of information to or from the affiliate that might result in a violation of the federal securities laws and regulations;

the dealer-manager is registered as a broker or dealer under Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act;<sup> 256 </sup>

the affiliate has no officers (or persons performing similar functions) or employees (other than clerical, ministerial, or support personnel) in common with the dealer-manager that direct, effect, or recommend transactions in securities; and 

 the purchases or arrangements to purchase are not made to facilitate the tender offer.

 

This exception, based largely upon the definition of "affiliated purchaser" in Rule 100 of Regulation M, allows investment affiliates to continue their investment advisory activities without interruption, on the same basis as they do during distributions subject to Rule 101 of Regulation M.<sup> 257 </sup> We believe effective information barriers between the dealer-manager and affiliate prevent improper motives from influencing purchases by affiliates while permitting such affiliates to continue their normal advisory activities. We are limiting this exception to the affiliates of dealer-managers that are registered under Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act because the dealer-managers are subject to a high level of regulatory and reporting oversight.<h>III. Effective Date and Transition> </h>

The new rules become effective on January 24, 2000. This date has been selected to accommodate the need for EDGAR programming before some of these changes become effective. The new rules are applicable to transactions beginning on or after the effective date, as well as to transactions already in progress on that date. The following addresses the application of the rules to some specific situations.<h>A. Communications </h>

As of the effective date, the new regulatory scheme for communications is in effect. Even if a registration statement, proxy statement or tender offer statement is filed before the effective date, persons may rely on the new exemptions for communications made on or after the effective date. Of course, they must comply with the conditions of the exemptions, including the filing of written communications.<h>B. Confidential Treatment of Proxy Material </h>

If preliminary proxy material is filed confidentially as permitted by the current rules before the effective date, the filer may choose to continue relying on the current rules after the effective date until the material is published, sent or given to security holders in definitive form. In that event, so long as parties to the transaction do not make public communications exceeding what would be permitted by the pre-effective date rules, the preliminary proxy material may remain confidential. On the other hand, if the parties to the transaction choose to avail themselves of the new communications exemptions before providing the definitive proxy statement, they must re-file the preliminary material publicly.<h>C. Early Commencement </h>

If a registration statement for an exchange offer is filed before the effective date of the new rules, and is not effective, the filer has the option of complying with the early commencement provisions as soon as the new rules become effective.<h>D. Disclosure Requirements and New Schedules </h>

The disclosure requirements have changed in a number of respects. If a registration statement, tender offer statement or proxy/information statement is filed before the effective date, the disclosure requirements in existence at that time continue to be applicable until the transaction is completed. Amendments should continue to comply with those requirements, not Regulation M-A or the revised rules. If a tender offer schedule relating to a two-tier transaction is filed before the effective date, pro forma financial information will not be required in the cash tender offer materials, even if it would be required for an offer filed on or after the effective date. However, we encourage offerors to provide this information. Amendments to tender offers filed before the effective date for the new rules should continue to be filed as amendments to Schedules 14D-1 or 13E-4, not Schedule TO. Tender offers commenced on or after the effective date must be filed on Schedule TO.<h>E. Subsequent Offering Period </h>

If a tender offer statement is filed before the effective date, the bidder may choose to provide a subsequent offering period beginning on or after the effective date. Of course, it must advise security holders of the decision to include a subsequent offering period in accordance with the timing discussed above, as this would be viewed as a material change. The announcement of a subsequent offering period may be made before the effective date.<h>F. Revised Security Holder List Rule for Tender Offers A request for the security holder list on or after the effective date is governed by the revised rule, whether or not the tender offer statement was filed before the effective date.G. New Rule 14e-5 </h><h>G. New Rule 14e-5 </h>

All tender offers that are publicly announced before the effective date of the amendment and redesignation of Rule 10b-13 as Rule 14e-5 are governed by Rule 10b-13, even if the tender offer extends beyond the effective date. Rule 14e-5 only applies to tender offers publicly announced on or after the effective date of the changes.<h>A. Communications </h><h>A. Communications </h>

As of the effective date, the new regulatory scheme for communications is in effect. Even if a registration statement, proxy statement or tender offer statement is filed before the effective date, persons may rely on the new exemptions for communications made on or after the effective date. Of course, they must comply with the conditions of the exemptions, including the filing of written communications.

 B. Confidential Treatment of Proxy Material 

If preliminary proxy material is filed confidentially as permitted by the current rules before the effective date, the filer may choose to continue relying on the current rules after the effective date until the material is published, sent or given to security holders in definitive form. In that event, so long as parties to the transaction do not make public communications exceeding what would be permitted by the pre-effective date rules, the preliminary proxy material may remain confidential. On the other hand, if the parties to the transaction choose to avail themselves of the new communications exemptions before providing the definitive proxy statement, they must re-file the preliminary material publicly.

 C. Early Commencement 

If a registration statement for an exchange offer is filed before the effective date of the new rules, and is not effective, the filer has the option of complying with the early commencement provisions as soon as the new rules become effective.

 D. Disclosure Requirements and New Schedules 

The disclosure requirements have changed in a number of respects. If a registration statement, tender offer statement or proxy/information statement is filed before the effective date, the disclosure requirements in existence at that time continue to be applicable until the transaction is completed. Amendments should continue to comply with those requirements, not Regulation M-A or the revised rules. If a tender offer schedule relating to a two-tier transaction is filed before the effective date, pro forma financial information will not be required in the cash tender offer materials, even if it would be required for an offer filed on or after the effective date. However, we encourage offerors to provide this information. Amendments to tender offers filed before the effective date for the new rules should continue to be filed as amendments to Schedules 14D-1 or 13E-4, not Schedule TO. Tender offers commenced on or after the effective date must be filed on Schedule TO.

 E. Subsequent Offering Period 

If a tender offer statement is filed before the effective date, the bidder may choose to provide a subsequent offering period beginning on or after the effective date. Of course, it must advise security holders of the decision to include a subsequent offering period in accordance with the timing discussed above, as this would be viewed as a material change. The announcement of a subsequent offering period may be made before the effective date.

 F. Revised Security Holder List Rule for Tender Offers A request for the security holder list on or after the effective date is governed by the revised rule, whether or not the tender offer statement was filed before the effective date.

 G. New Rule 14e-5 

All tender offers that are publicly announced before the effective date of the amendment and redesignation of Rule 10b-13 as Rule 14e-5 are governed by Rule 10b-13, even if the tender offer extends beyond the effective date. Rule 14e-5 only applies to tender offers publicly announced on or after the effective date of the changes.

 IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis 

We expect that the amendments adopted today will facilitate and enhance security holder communications, especially before a registration statement relating to a business combination transaction, proxy statement or tender offer statement is filed. The amendments also will update and simplify the rules and regulations applicable to business combination transactions, including tender offers, mergers, and similar extraordinary transactions. Accordingly, we expect the cost of compliance with the applicable rules and regulations will decrease as a result of these amendments.

In addition to permitting more communications with security holders, the amendments attempt to place cash and stock tender offers on a more equal regulatory footing. We also have integrated the forms and disclosure requirements applicable to issuer tender offers, third-party tender offers and going-private transactions while consolidating the disclosure requirements in one central location within the regulations. We expect that these changes will simplify compliance with the regulations. Further, the amendments will permit bidders to provide a subsequent offering period after the successful completion of a tender offer when security holders can tender their securities without having to wait for a back-end merger. The regulations are revised to more closely align the merger and tender offer requirements as well as update the tender offer rules to clarify certain requirements and reduce compliance burdens consistent with investor protection. We expect that these changes will reduce the compliance burden on registrants and generally facilitate the consummation of transactions.

In the Proposing Release we provided our preliminary cost-benefit analysis and requested that commenters provide their views on the specific costs and benefits associated with our proposals. We also requested that commenters provide any data supporting their views. While commenters addressed the potential costs and benefits of the proposals in general terms, none provided empirical data to support their views. We discuss below the expected benefits and costs of the revisions and focus on the groups of persons and entities that are likely to be affected by the changes adopted today.

 A. Communications 

Overall, the amendments should enhance price discovery and market efficiency by permitting companies to communicate earlier and more freely about proposed business combination transactions and other significant corporate events. Currently, provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, including the Williams Act, restrict the dissemination of information before a registration, proxy or tender offer statement is filed. The amendments allow companies to communicate more freely with security holders both before and after the filing of a registration, proxy, or tender offer statement.<sup> 258 </sup> The revisions allowing more communications treat bidders and targets alike _ both are free to communicate with security holders regarding the merits and potential risks of a proposed transaction.

We expect that the increased flow of information will assist investors in making better-informed tender or voting decisions. We recognize that under the regulatory scheme adopted today there is a risk some persons may attempt to "condition the market" with false, misleading or confusing information.<sup> 259 </sup> Nevertheless, we believe that investors will benefit from an increased flow of information and they will eventually receive a registration, tender offer or proxy statement before an investment, tender or voting decision must be made with respect to a particular transaction. As a result, we expect investors will have adequate opportunity to consider the full information in the mandated disclosure document together with any information disseminated earlier before needing to act on that information.

In addition, the increased flow of information will be subject to liability. Communications that are made at any time will be subject to the antifraud provisions of Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, as well as to the antifraud provisions of Rule 14a-9 and Section 14(e) if a transaction involves the proxy or tender offer rules, respectively. Also, if the transaction involves the Securities Act, the communications will be subject to Section 12(a)(2) liability as well. In addition, all material information must be included in the registration statement that is ultimately declared effective; therefore the information will be subject to Section 11 liability. In the aggregate, the liability imposed on these communications is appropriate to discourage the dissemination of false or misleading information into the market while at the same time providing investors with more information about a proposed transaction on a timely basis. We do not expect that these amendments will present a significant burden to investors or offerors.<sup> 260 </sup> Although communications are subject to liability, the amendments essentially permit communications that would not otherwise be permitted today and parties have the option of whether or not to communicate more with security holders and the markets.

The amendments also should reduce the current regulatory uncertainty relating to security holder communications. Companies have indicated difficulty in complying with the current restrictions on communications while at the same time fulfilling their duties to make full and fair disclosure under Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. By relaxing the current restrictions on communications, this regulatory tension should be minimized. This clarification is expected to benefit issuers and security holders alike.

One potential cost or risk of the amendments is that some security holders may make investment decisions based on information received before a complete disclosure statement containing the required information is filed. While some investors may make premature investment decisions, the same risk exists today under the current rules. For example, the tender offer rules currently limit communications with investors until an offer is formally commenced. The required disclosure statement, however, is not required to be filed until five business days after the announcement of an offer. In addition, the information required in the mandated disclosure document may not be received by security holders until several days after the material is filed. By allowing companies to publicly announce transactions without having to file mandated disclosure documents, together with the requirement that all written communications relating to a proposed transaction be publicly filed and contain a legend advising security holders to read the complete disclosure document when it is available,<sup> 261 </sup> we believe investors will have more information and more time to make an informed investment decision. Further, investors will receive a mandated disclosure document before the time they must decide whether or not to tender in an offer.

To protect investors from possible misleading information, we are adopting new Rule 14e-8 which specifically prohibits the announcement of a tender offer if the bidder does not intend to commence and complete the offer; intends to manipulate the market price of the bidder or target; or does not have a reasonable belief it will have the means to purchase the securities sought in the offer. This new rule should encourage only bona fide offers to be publicly announced and minimize the potential for dissemination of false or misleading information in the marketplace.

In addition to permitting more communications, we believe that the amendments will reduce selective disclosure of information because companies must publicly file all written communications relating to the transaction. This filing requirement will make written communications available to a broader base of investors than is currently the case. The amendments also should increase the uniformity and timeliness of information received by investors. We recognize, of course, that the amendments will not eliminate selective disclosure entirely. In fact, the amendments may encourage companies to communicate orally instead of in writing to avoid the filing requirement. Because the market will likely demand that information be reduced to writing and companies generally will want to disseminate information broadly in order to sell their transaction to the market, we expect that the communications scheme adopted will reduce selective disclosure overall.

The revisions also will permit significantly more communications under the proxy rules, regardless of whether the communications relate to a business combination transaction. Under the amended rules, companies and security holders may communicate more freely before having to furnish a written proxy statement.<sup> 262 </sup> The increased ability to communicate under the amendments adopted today applies equally to security holders and companies. As a result, we expect security holders will receive more information regarding matters on which a vote may be solicited in the future. In addition, the revisions should result in the dissemination of information earlier than is currently the case, giving security holders more time to consider that information.

We are requiring companies to provide security holders with a short "plain English" summary term sheet in all cash mergers, cash tender offers, and going-private transactions.<sup> 263 </sup> We expect that the required summary term sheet will facilitate investors' understanding of the basic terms of a proposed transaction, allowing them to make better-informed voting and investment decisions. We do not expect the requirement to impose a significant burden on filers because the information required in a summary term sheet must be gathered to respond to existing disclosure requirements in any event. Further, most filers should be sufficiently experienced with the plain English requirements applicable to Securities Act filings.<h>B. Filings </h>

The amendments should effectively reduce the cost of complying with many of the current disclosure and other regulatory requirements. We have integrated and streamlined the current disclosure requirements applicable to business combination and going-private transactions. To a large extent the amendments harmonize and integrate the disclosure requirements for tender offer, merger proxy, and going-private transaction statements. The various disclosure requirements now appear in one location and are written in a more reader-friendly manner. Also, the amendments permit the filing of one schedule, rather than two, to satisfy the tender offer and going-private disclosure requirements when both sets of regulations apply to a particular transaction.

Consistent with the free communications scheme adopted today, we are limiting the availability of confidential treatment of merger proxy statements. Under the amendments, filers will be permitted to file a merger proxy statement confidentially so long as the parties limit their public oral and written communications to the information specified in Rule 135 of the Securities Act. If the parties to the transaction elect to publicly disclose more information than that specified in Rule 135, the proxy statement must be filed publicly. We do not expect that this limitation on confidential treatment will impose significant costs on filers. The revised treatment of merger proxy statements is consistent with the current requirement to publicly file all other registration, proxy, tender offer and going-private statements. The same information must be filed regardless of whether confidential treatment is invoked by the filer.

We expect the amendments also will reduce the burden of complying with the merger proxy and tender offer requirements by, among other things:

 

clarifying the disclosure requirements;

clarifying that an acquiror's financial statements are required in all-cash transactions only when the acquiror cannot demonstrate a financial ability to satisfy the terms of the transaction or the information is otherwise material;

eliminating the requirement to provide target financial statement information in an all-cash merger when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction;

reducing from three years to as little as one year, and in some cases eliminating, the required financial statements for a non-reporting target company when the acquiring company's security holders are not voting on the transaction; and

reducing from three years to two the required financial statements for an acquiring company in cash mergers and third-party cash tender offers. 

We are adopting, however, a new disclosure requirement that may impose an additional cost on acquirors in negotiated two-tier business combination transactions. If security holders will be offered cash first in a tender offer followed by securities in a back-end merger, an acquiror must disclose certain pro forma and related financial information for the combined entity in the cash tender offer materials. We do not expect that this requirement will impose a significant burden on acquirors because the same information would eventually be required for the back-end merger. The amendments require disclosure at an earlier point in time, when security holders are confronted with a cash tender offer and must decide whether to tender in the offer or wait to receive securities in the back-end. The pro forma information required will benefit investors and should not impose a significant burden on acquirors. Therefore, the costs associated with providing pro forma information is reasonable. We recognize, however, that some acquirors may have difficulty in generating reliable pro forma financial information in situations when the target is not cooperating with the bidder. In response to this concern, we have limited the pro forma requirement to negotiated transactions.

For the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, Table 2 in Part VII below summarizes our estimate of the paperwork burden hours that parties would expend to comply with the amended rules. In arriving at these estimates we note that U.S. merger and acquisition activity in 1998 was valued in excess of $1.3 trillion.<sup> 264 </sup> These estimates include the burden hours incurred by companies from filing pre-filing communications. We have based these estimates on current burden hour estimates and the staff's experience with these filings. The estimates in the table indicate that parties would expend approximately 234,759 burden hours/year complying with the revised rules. If we assume that 70% of the burden hours would be expended by persons that cost the affected parties $85/hour ( e.g. , professionals) and 30% of these burden hours would be expended by persons that cost $10/hour ( e.g. , clerical support), then the proposals would cost approximately $14,691,250/year in internal staff time. We expect that a majority of the compliance burden will fall on professionals while approximately one-third of the burden will rest on clerical staff that will monitor and implement the compliance process.

For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, we also estimate that parties would spend approximately $122,929,990/year on outside professional assistance to comply with the proposals. Thus, we estimate that affected parties would spend approximately $137,621,240/year to comply with the paperwork requirements of the amended rules. Applying the same cost estimates to the burden imposed by the current rules, we estimate that companies and affected parties spend approximately $163,268,490/year.<sup> 265 </sup> Note that these estimates do not attempt to quantify intangible benefits of the amended rules, such as the benefits to issuers and investors of enhanced communications and possible improvements in price discovery, nor intangible costs.<h>C. Tender Offers </h>

We are providing bidders with more flexibility regarding the timing of exchange offers. Currently, bidders may not commence an exchange offer until the related registration statement is effective. Under the amendments, bidders will be able to commence an exchange offer as soon as they file a registration statement, or on a later date if desired. Offerors will no longer need to wait for effectiveness to commence an exchange offer. We expect that this increased flexibility will encourage issuers to file their registration statements earlier, thereby creating an incentive to publicly disseminate more information sooner rather than selectively communicate with a limited number of security holders. In addition, we expect the attempt at balancing the regulatory treatment of cash and stock offers will enhance the attractiveness of offering securities, more so than is currently the case. The increased feasibility of offering securities as an alternative to cash should result in a more competitive market for target companies overall.

We realize that the ability to commence an offer early will likely shorten the period of time necessary to complete an exchange offer relative to the time currently required. We retain, however, certain investor protection mechanisms, including a requirement that a bidder may not purchase securities tendered in an exchange offer until the related registration statement is effective. In addition, the exchange offer may not expire until after the mandatory 20-business day tender offer period has elapsed. The bidder must disseminate a supplement to security holders containing all material changes to the information previously disseminated and security holders may withdraw tendered securities at any time until purchased by the bidder.

We also recognize that early commencement may increase the risk that bidders offering securities will need to disseminate supplements to disclose changes in material information. This may cause bidders to incur additional costs in redisseminating information and security holders will need to reconsider their investment decisions upon receipt of the new information. The risk is not unique to exchange offers, however, because bidders run the same risk today in cash tender offers when there is a material change in information. We do not expect that the costs associated with redissemination will be overly burdensome because early commencement is at the bidder's election. Bidders are not required to commence immediately upon filing. Instead, bidders can file a registration statement and wait for staff comments before disseminating offering materials and commencing the offer, thereby minimizing both the need for supplements and the costs associated with redissemination.

The amendments also permit bidders to purchase (at the stated offer price) securities from holders who did not tender their shares during the offer in a follow-on period called a "subsequent offering period." We expect this change will minimize the delay security holders currently encounter in liquidating their investment in a target company when the bidder is successful in purchasing a significant or controlling interest in the target. We recognize that some security holders might wait to tender their shares until the subsequent offering period, thus creating a hold-out problem for some bidders. We do not believe, however, that the need to announce a subsequent offering period in advance will pose a significant hold-out risk because most bidders will not be willing to close the initial offering period until a sufficient number of securities have been tendered in the offer. Therefore, security holders will need to tender a sufficient number of securities into an offer before the bidder will close the initial offering period and purchase the securities tendered in the offer. As a result, the economics of the transaction will drive a sufficient number of security holders to tender. In addition, we note that bidders are not required to provide a subsequent offering period, but may do so at their election.

We are reducing the financial statement requirement in third-party cash tender offers from three years to two when the information is material. This change harmonizes the financial statement requirement in third-party tender offers with the requirements for issuer tender offers and going-private transactions. We expect that this reduction from three to two years of historical financial statements will lower a bidder's costs to comply with our rules, while continuing to give security holders adequate information to make investment decisions.

The amendments also allow bidders greater access to security holders in tender offers by enabling them to contact non-objecting beneficial owners if the target company maintains a list of these persons. The amendment is expected to give bidders the same ability as target companies to communicate directly with non-objecting beneficial owners of securities similar to that provided under the proxy rules. This revision should benefit both bidders and security holders because communications regarding tender offers will be more efficient than they are today. The amendments do not require targets to gather this information. Instead, the information must be provided only when the target has the information and elects to provide the bidder with security holder list information instead of mailing the tender offer materials for the bidder. Accordingly, we do not expect the revised rule will impose significant costs on target companies.<h>V. Commission Findings and ConsiderationsA. Exemptive Authority Findings </h><h>A. Exemptive Authority Findings </h>

We find that it is appropriate, in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors to exempt: (i) persons making communications regarding planned business combination or similar takeover transactions from Sections 5(b)(1) and (c) of the Securities Act; and (ii) exchange offers commencing early from Section 5(a) and (b)(2) of the Securities Act. We make these findings based on the reasons described in this release. In particular, we believe that investors will be better served if they are able to receive more information concerning business combination transactions before the time they must make an investment decision.

Our use of exemptive authority will allow companies to communicate more freely with security holders and the markets and will permit investors to receive more information in a timely manner. If security holders receive more information sooner, they will be able to better inform themselves before having to make an investment decision. In addition, our use of exemptive authority will help minimize the regulatory disparity between exchange offers and cash tender offers. If bidders can choose more freely between offering cash or securities as consideration in a business combination, the markets will operate more efficiently and security holders will benefit as a result.

In light of improved technologies that permit more and faster communications with security holders and the markets, and the increasing speed at which business combination transactions are consummated, we believe that removing restraints on communications will benefit investors. Therefore, we have found that persons making communications regarding these types of transactions should be free to communicate earlier, before a formal registration statement is filed or a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10(a) of the Securities Act is delivered.

We realize that these exemptions will lead to significantly more communications, some of which could be incomplete in the absence of a mandated disclosure document. We believe, however, that investors will be adequately protected by our continuing requirement to furnish security holders with a complete disclosure document before an investment decision must be made. In addition, we believe that the level of liability imposed on these pre- and post-filing communications will be adequate to protect investors.<h>B. Effect on Competition </h>

Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act<sup> 266 </sup> requires us, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact those rules would have on competition. We cannot adopt any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in the public interest.

We did not receive any information from commenters on the impact of increased competition for capital in connection with business combination transactions. We also received no comments on whether the new rules, schedules and amendments will have an adverse effect on competition or will impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. Harmonizing the requirements between cash and exchange offers removes burdens on competition. Our view, therefore, is that any anti-competitive effects of the new rules, schedules and amendments adopted today are necessary or appropriate in the public interest.<h>C. Promotion of Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation </h>

Section 2(b) of the Securities Act<sup> 267 </sup> and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act,<sup> 268 </sup> as amended by the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996,<sup> 269 </sup> provide that whenever the Commission is engaged in rulemaking and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission also must consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital formation. We believe that harmonizing the regulatory requirements between cash tender and exchange offers will promote efficiency and competition. In addition, facilitating communications with security holders will promote efficiency and capital formation.<h>VI. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </h>

This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis ("FRFA") has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act ("RFA"), as amended by Public Law No. 104-121, 110 Stat. 847, 864 (1996), 5 U.S.C. §604. The FRFA relates to the new rules, amendments, and schedules adopted today, which are primarily intended to enhance communications with security holders; harmonize the regulations affecting cash and stock tender offers; facilitate compliance with the rules and regulations associated with business combination transactions and similar extraordinary transactions; and promote investor protection.<h>A. Need for Action </h>

 Communications 

Currently, the rules and regulations applicable to business combination transactions impose restrictions on communications during the period before a mandated disclosure document is publicly filed with us. These restrictions appear in the registration, proxy and tender offer rules.<sup> 270 </sup> Companies, security holders and other market participants have expressed an increasing desire to communicate and receive information about proposed business combination transactions before the time that a mandated disclosure document ( e.g. , a registration, proxy or tender offer statement) is filed. This desire is partly attributable to the emergence of new and developing technologies that allow for faster and less expensive means to communicate. In addition, disclosure requirements under both the federal securities laws and applicable exchange rules and regulations may require disclosure. Further, participants to business combination transactions often feel compelled to promptly inform the marketplace, their employees, suppliers, and customers about a proposed business combination transaction that potentially could impact their relationships with these constituencies. We also have recognized that business combination transactions differ from capital-raising transactions to the extent that security holders may be forced to take cash or securities in exchange for their securities even though no action is taken with respect to the transaction.

Accordingly, we have decided to eliminate many of the restrictions imposed on communications before a mandated disclosure document is filed by adopting specific exemptions under each regulatory scheme that could apply to a business combination transaction. Revised Securities Act Rules 135 and 145 and new Rules 165, 166 and 425 permit more communications regarding a business combination transaction before a registration statement is filed. Revised proxy Rule 14a-12 permits more communications regardless of whether a business combination transaction is involved before a proxy statement must be filed. Revised tender offer Rule 14d-2 permits a bidder to communicate more information without having to formally commence its tender offer or file a tender offer statement. Revised tender offer Rule 14d-9 permits a target to respond to a bidder's announcement of a proposed tender offer before commencement of the offer without having to file a solicitation/recommendation statement.

In each case, the person making communications must file all written communications made in connection with or relating to the transaction on the date of first use. The written communications must contain a brief legend advising security holders to read the applicable mandated disclosure document when it is filed together with any other documents that may be available. Under the new regulatory scheme security holders must be furnished with the traditional mandated disclosure document before they must make an investment or voting decision. This new regulatory scheme facilitates the dissemination of more information to security holders at an earlier point in time, providing security holders with a greater opportunity to consider the information in light of all other information available, including the mandated disclosure document that must be furnished before action can be taken.

 Balancing the Regulation of Stock and Cash Tender Offers 

Currently, a bidder offering securities as consideration in an exchange offer may not commence the offer until a related registration statement is effective.<sup> 271 </sup> This differs in a significant respect from cash tender offers that may commence as soon as a tender statement is filed and the required information disseminated to security holders. This disparity in regulatory treatment of cash and stock tender offers may influence a bidder's choice of consideration offered in a tender offer. In order to provide bidders with more flexibility on the form of consideration to offer in a business combination transaction, we are revising the rules to permit the commencement of exchange offers before a related registration statement is effective.<sup> 272 </sup> A bidder, however, may not close its exchange offer and purchase the tendered securities until after the related registration statement is effective. Bidders also must deliver a preliminary prospectus containing all required information in addition to supplements or amendments that disclose material changes from the prospectus previously furnished. This balancing of the regulatory treatment of cash and stock tender offers will provide bidders with increased flexibility to choose between cash and securities as consideration in a business combination transaction without impairing the current level of investor protection afforded to security holders.

 Harmonizing, Clarifying and Updating the Disclosure Requirements 

In some cases the current rules relating to business combination transactions require differing levels and types of information based on how the transaction is structured. If a transaction is structured as a merger instead of a tender offer, the required disclosure may differ unnecessarily. For example, a fully-financed, all-cash merger generally requires three years of financial statements for the company to be acquired,<sup> 273 </sup> while a fully-financed, all-cash all-share tender offer generally will not require any financial statement information for either the bidder or the target unless that information is material.<sup> 274 </sup> In addition, there are other areas where the required level of information may differ unnecessarily. For example, issuer tender offers and going-private transactions generally require two years of financial statements while third-party tender offers require three years of financial statements, when material.

This disparity in required disclosure may be attributed in part to the fact that the disclosure requirements were not adopted at the same time, resulting in some minor inconsistencies or differences. The new and revised schedules<sup> 275 </sup> and disclosure items<sup> 276 </sup> serve to integrate the disclosure requirements, harmonizing the requirements to the extent practicable and appropriate. The revisions adopted will facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements applicable to business combination transactions and going-private transactions while maintaining all substantive disclosure requirements appropriate to the transaction.<h>B. Objectives of the Rule Amendments </h>

The new rules, schedules and amendments are expected to reduce compliance costs overall for all persons that are subject to our rules and regulations, benefiting both small and large business entities. As a result of the amendments adopted, security holders, including small entities, should receive more information on a timely basis. In addition, persons subject to our rules should have greater flexibility in structuring and completing tender offers, mergers, and other extraordinary transactions. Also as a result of the amendments, bidders should realize greater flexibility in selecting the form of consideration to offer in a tender offer ( e.g. , cash or securities). We expect that our revisions harmonizing, clarifying and updating the disclosure requirements will facilitate compliance with the rules and regulations as well as improve the disclosure that security holders ultimately receive in business combination transactions.<h>C. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by the Public Comments </h>

We requested comment with respect to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis ("IRFA") that was prepared when the new rules, amendments and schedules were proposed. We did not receive any comments with respect to the IRFA.<h>D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities Subject to the New Rules </h>

We adopted definitions of the term "small business" for the various entities subject to our rulemaking. Rule 157 under the Securities Act<sup> 277 </sup> and Rule 0-10 under the Exchange Act<sup> 278 </sup> provide that "small business issuer" includes an issuer, other than an investment company, that has total assets of $5 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. For purposes of the RFA, an investment company is a small business if the investment company, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year.<sup> 279 </sup>

Currently, we are aware of approximately 836 reporting companies that are not investment companies with assets of $5 million or less. In addition, there are approximately 320 investment companies that satisfy the "small business" definition. All of these companies could potentially be subject to at least some of the new rules, schedules, and amendments. We expect small businesses will be affected by these amendments to the extent that they are involved in a business combination transaction. In addition, small businesses may be affected by the amendments made to the proxy rules, which permit significantly greater communications with and among security holders. Small entities that are required to file registration statements, proxy statements, tender offer statements and other reports under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Investment Company Act will be affected by these amendments. Finally, small entities may be affected as shareholders in companies that are part of a business combination.

We have no reliable way of determining or estimating the number of reporting or non-reporting small businesses that may seek to rely on or would otherwise be affected by the new rules, schedules and amendments. We believe, however, that these amendments will substantially benefit both small and large entities to the extent they will substantially reduce current restrictions on communications and generally facilitate compliance with existing rules and regulations. In addition, because many of the amendments represent exemptions from existing rules and regulations, small businesses can decide whether the burdens imposed by the requirements ( e.g. , the filing of written communications) outweigh the related benefits ( e.g. , the ability to communicate more freely).<h>E. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements </h>

We believe that the new rules, schedules and amendments are primarily deregulatory in nature because they significantly expand the ability of businesses to structure and time their business combination transactions and communicate with security holders. In addition, security holders in general will be afforded a greater opportunity to receive information and communicate with other security holders. The resulting increase in flexibility to communicate will benefit companies as well as security holders.

Under the amendments, small businesses will report and file essentially the same information as they do today. One exception to this generalization, however, is that both large and small bidders are required to publicly file all pre- and post-filing written communications relating to proposed business combination transactions. This filing requirement is necessary due to the deregulation of pre-filing communications. Companies are not obligated to communicate with security holders, but to the extent that they do communicate in writing, those communications must be filed on the date of first use. The new rules, schedules, and amendments adopted today treat all persons and entities alike, and do not make any distinctions based on size.<h>F. Description of Steps Taken to Minimize the Effect on Small Entities </h>

We are directed by the RFA to consider significant alternatives to proposals that would accomplish our stated objectives while minimizing any significant adverse economic impact on small entities. In connection with the proposals presented in the Proposing Release, the views expressed by commenters, and our extensive review of existing rules and regulations, we considered several possible alternatives, including:

 

establishing different compliance and reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources of small businesses;

clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small businesses;

using performance rather than design standards; and

exempting small businesses from all or part of the requirements. 

Because the new rules, schedules, and amendments are primarily deregulatory in nature, any different treatment of small business entities would likely be more burdensome to small business entities. The amendments significantly expand the ability of businesses to structure and time their business combination transactions and communicate with security holders, while maintaining investor protections. While we considered excluding smaller entities from the new rules, schedules, and amendments, we concluded that the benefits of the amendments should apply to all businesses regardless of their size. If small business were exempted, in most cases they would be subject to more rather than less regulation. Accordingly, we decided not to limit the new rules and amendments and their corresponding benefits to larger issuers.

Accordingly, we do not believe any benefit can be achieved by providing separate disclosure requirements for small issuers based on the use of performance rather than design standards.<h>VII. Paperwork Reduction Act </h>

In November, 1998, the staff submitted the proposed new rules, schedules and amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. §3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. Also, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, we solicited comment on the compliance burdens associated with the proposals. We did not receive any public comments that quantified the estimated paperwork burdens associated with the new rules, schedules and amendments. The comments we received primarily addressed the costs and benefits of the proposals in general terms. We discuss these general comments above in more detail.

The new rules, schedules and amendments will affect several regulations and forms that contain "collection of information requirements" within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.<sup> 280 </sup> An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Table 1 below provides the titles for the affected collections of information under the Exchange Act, current OMB control numbers, where applicable, a summary of the collection of information, and a description of the likely respondents to each collection of information.<sup> 281 </sup>

 Table 1: Collections of Information Under the Securities Act and Exchange Act 

 Title OMB Control Number Summary of the Collection of Information and Description of Likely Respondents Schedule14A 3235-0059 If a vote of security holders is required, persons soliciting proxies with respect to securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act must furnish security holders with a proxy statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14A. The proxy statement is intended to provide security holders with the information necessary to enable them to make an informed voting decision on any matters that will be acted upon at an annual or special meeting of security holders. Schedule14C 3235-0057 If a vote of security holders is required, but proxies are not being solicited, companies with securities registered under Section 12 of Exchange Act must send an information statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14C to every security holder that would be entitled to vote on the matters presented at a meeting at which a vote will be taken. Schedule13E-3 3235-0007 Companies or their affiliates engaging in specified transactions that cause a class of the company's equity securities registered under the Exchange Act to be: 1) held by fewer than 300 record holders; or 2) de-listed from a securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system must file and disseminate to security holders the information specified in Schedule 13E-3. This schedule requires detailed information addressing whether the filing persons believe the transaction is fair to unaffiliated security holders and why. Schedule14D-9 3235-0102 Issuers of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act that make a solicitation or recommendation to security holders regarding a third-party tender offer subject to Regulation 14D must file and send to security holders the information specified in Schedule 14D-9. Schedule13E-4 3235-0203 Issuers of securities registered under Section 12 or reporting under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and certain of their affiliates, must file and disseminate to security holders the information specified in Schedule 13E-4 when making a tender offer for any class of the issuer's equity securities. Schedule14D-1 3235-0102 Any person, other than the issuer, making a tender offer for equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, that would result in that person owning greater than five percent of the class of the securities subject to the offer, must at the time of the offer file and disseminate the information specified in Schedule 14D-1 to the issuer, security holders and competing bidders. ScheduleTO 3235-0515 Any person making a tender offer for securities that would have to file a Schedule 13E-4 or 14D-1 must now file and disseminate to security holders the information specified in Schedule TO, instead of Schedule 13E-4 or 14D-1 . 

The new rules, schedules, and amendments update and simplify the rules and regulations applicable to business combination transactions. The information required by these schedules is needed so that security holders can make an informed tender or voting decision with respect to tender offers, mergers, acquisitions, and other extraordinary transactions. We enhance communications between public companies and investors by providing companies with greater flexibility to determine when to file their registration statements involving takeover transactions, proxy statements, and tender offer statements. We also attempt to put cash and stock tender offers on a more equal regulatory footing; integrate the forms and disclosure requirements in issuer tender offers, third-party tender offers and going-private transactions; and consolidate the disclosure requirements in one location in the regulations. In addition, we allow bidders to accept tenders from security holders during a limited period after the successful completion of the tender offer; more closely align the merger and tender offer requirements; and update the tender offer rules to clarify certain requirements and reduce compliance burdens where consistent with investor protection.

The schedules and regulations affected by these changes set forth the public disclosures that offerors are required to make concerning business combination transactions. For the most part the disclosure requirements in the above schedules remain the same, with a few limited exceptions. Specifically, revised Schedules 14A, 14C, 13E-3, 14D-9, and new Schedule TO requires a brief "plain English" summary term sheet highlighting the most significant aspects of a particular transaction in all cash mergers, cash tender offers, and going-private transactions.<sup> 282 </sup> The amendments also reduce in certain instances the number of years of financial statements that are required in Schedules 14A and 14C for acquirors and companies being acquired in cash mergers. For example, Schedules 14A and 14C no longer require the financial statements of the target in a cash merger when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction.

New Schedule TO, which replaces current Schedules 13E-4 and 14D-1, harmonizes and clarifies the disclosure requirements in issuer and third-party tender offers. For example, currently when a third-party bidder's financial statement information is material to security holders, three years of financial statements are required while only two years is required for issuers making an issuer tender offer. New Schedule TO requires only two years of financial statements for the bidder if that information is material, regardless of whether an issuer or third-party is making the tender offer. In a negotiated two-tier transaction, Schedule TO will require the bidder to provide security holders with certain pro forma financial and other related information for the combined entity at the time of the cash tender offer. In addition, the amendments permit the filing of one schedule, rather than two, to satisfy the tender offer and going-private disclosure requirements when both sets of regulations apply to the transaction. As a result, the amendments are expected to reduce the number of filings required.

The information collection requirements imposed by the schedules and regulations are mandatory to the extent that companies are publicly-owned and engage in business combination transactions. There is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed. The information gathered by these schedules and regulation is made publicly available, unless confidential treatment is available. Confidential treatment of information in preliminary merger proxy statements is retained to a limited extent.

As discussed in more detail in Part IV above, the amendments reduce the burden of complying with the disclosure and transaction requirements applicable to business combination transactions. We estimate that public companies will expend approximately 988,986 burden hours/year to comply with the new rules, schedules, and amendments.

Table 2 below summarizes our estimates of the burden hours that filers will expend to comply with the new rules, amendments and schedules. We expect compliance costs will be less than current costs because the amendments primarily integrate and streamline the disclosure requirements for business combination transactions. Our estimates include the burden hours that will be incurred by companies to file pre-filing written communications. We base these estimates on current burden hour estimates and the staff's experience with these filings. The estimates in the table indicate that filers will expend approximately 234,759 burden hours/year to comply with the amendments. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, we estimate that filers will spend approximately $122,929,990/year on outside professional help to comply with the amendments. The estimates are discussed in greater detail below.

We expect that the amendments will reduce the number of burden hours required to file a full Schedule 14A from 87 hours today to 70 hours under the amendments.<sup> 284 </sup> Of the 70 hours, we estimate that 25% (17.5 internal burden hours) will be provided by corporate staff, and 75% (52.5 hours) by external professional help. Based on filings received in fiscal year 1998, we anticipate that companies and other filers will file approximately 9,892 full Schedule 14As/year. Under the amendments, companies and other filers also are required to file under cover of Schedule 14A any pre-filing written communications (in addition to the required proxy statement) concerning business combinations for cash.<sup> 285 </sup> Revised Rule 14a-12 requires filers to file their pre- and post-filing written communications and include certain information including a legend advising security holders to read the proxy statement. In fiscal year 1998, approximately 9,892 full Schedule 14As were filed. We estimate that approximately 34% of the full Schedule 14As filed will involve cash rather than securities.<sup> 286 </sup> We also estimate that filers, on average, will file one written communication (in addition to the required proxy statement) for each cash transaction. We estimate that a firm's corporate staff will expend approximately 15 burden minutes (0.25 internal burden hours) to file a written communication under the amended rules.<sup> 287 </sup> Thus, we estimate filers will file 9,892 full Schedule 14As/year (expending 17.5 internal burden hours/filing) and 3,363 written communications/year (expending 0.25 internal burden hours/filing).<sup> </sup>On average, filers will require approximately 13.12 internal burden hours to file 13,255 full Schedule 14As and written communications. In addition, we anticipate filers will spend, at an estimated $175/hour, approximately $9,188/filing in professional labor costs to file a Schedule 14A.<sup> 288 </sup>

We anticipate the amendments will reduce the number of hours required to file a full Schedule 14C from 87 hours today to 70 hours under the amendments. Of the 70 hours, we estimate that 25% (17.5 internal burden hours) will be provided by corporate staff, and 75% (52.5 hours) by external professional help. Based on filings in fiscal year 1998, we anticipate that companies and other filers will file approximately 253 full Schedule 14Cs/year. Under the amended rules, companies and other filers also are required to file under cover of Schedule 14C any pre-filing written communications (in addition to the required proxy statement) concerning business combinations for cash.<sup> 289 </sup> The amendments require filers to file their written communications and include certain information including a legend advising security holders to read the information statement. In fiscal year 1998, approximately 253 full Schedule 14Cs were filed. We estimate that 34% of the full Schedule 14Cs will involve cash rather than securities.<sup> 290 </sup> We estimate that filers, on average, will file one written communication (in addition to the required information statement) for each cash transaction. We estimate that a firm's corporate staff will expend approximately 15 burden minutes (0.25 internal burden hours) to file a written communication under the amended rules. Thus, we estimate filers will file 253 full Schedule 14Cs/year (expending 52.50 burden hours/filing) and 86 written communications/year (expending 0.25 internal burden hours/filing). On average, filers will require approximately 13.12 internal burden hours to file 339 full Schedule 14Cs and written communications. In addition, we anticipate filers will spend, at an estimated $175/hour, approximately $9,188/filing in professional labor costs to file a full Schedule 14C.<sup> 291 </sup>

The amendments clarify and make several technical changes to Schedule 13E-3. As a result, we anticipate a savings of two hours, from 139.25 hours/filing to 137.25 hours/filing, to file Schedule 13E-3 under the amendments. Of the 137.25 hours, we estimate that 25% (34.31 internal burden hours) will be provided by corporate staff, and 75% (102.94 hours) by external professional help. Based on filings in fiscal year 1998, we estimate filers will file 96 Schedule 13E-3s/year. In addition, we anticipate filers will spend, at an estimated $175/hour, approximately $18,015/filing in professional labor costs to file a full Schedule 13E-3.<sup> 292 </sup>

The amendments clarify and make several technical changes to Schedule 14D-9. As a result, we anticipate a savings of two hours, from 354.25 hours/filing to 352.25 hours/filing, to file a full Schedule 14D-9 under the amendments. Of the 352.25 hours, we estimate that 25% (88.06 internal burden hours) will be provided by corporate staff, and 75% (264.19 hours) by external professional help. Based on filings in fiscal year 1998, we anticipate that companies and other filers will file approximately 258 full Schedule 14D-9s/year. Under the amendments, companies and other filers also are required to file under cover of Schedule 14D-9 any pre- or post-filing written communications (in addition to the required proxy statement) concerning business combinations for cash.<sup> 293 </sup> The rule requires filers to attach their written communications and include certain information including a legend advising security holders to read the full recommendation statement. In fiscal year 1998, approximately 258 full Schedule 14D-9s were filed. We estimate that 37% of the full Schedule 14D-9s filed will involve cash rather than securities.<sup> 294 </sup> We estimate that filers, on average, will file one written communication (in addition to the required information statement) for each cash transaction. We estimate that a firm's corporate staff will expend approximately 15 burden minutes (0.25 internal burden hours) to file a written communication under Rule 425. Thus, we estimate filers will file 258 full Schedule 14D-9s /year (expending 88.06 internal burden hours/filing) and 95 written communications/year (expending 0.25 internal burden hours/filing). On average, filers will require approximately 64.43 internal burden hours to file 353 full Schedule 14D-9s and written communications. In addition, we anticipate filers will spend, at an estimated $175/hour, approximately $46,233/filing in professional labor costs to file a full Schedule 14D-9.<sup> 295 </sup>

Under the amendments new Schedule TO replaces current Schedules 13E-4 and 14D-1. Schedule TO harmonizes and clarifies the requirements in current Schedules 13E-4 and 14D-1. Based on the number of Schedule 13E-4 and Schedule 14D-1s filed in fiscal year 1998, and the number of hours required to complete them, we estimate that bidders will require approximately 309 hours to file a full Schedule TO under the amended rules.<sup> 296 </sup> Of the 309 hours, we estimate that 25% (77.25 internal burden hours) will be provided by corporate staff, and 75% (231.75 hours) by external professional help. Based on filings in fiscal year 1998, we anticipate that companies and other filers will file approximately 396 full Schedule TOs/year. Under the amendments, companies and other filers also will be required to file under Schedule TO all pre- and post filing written communications (in addition to the required tender offer statement) concerning all cash tender offers.<sup> 297 </sup> The amendments require filers to file their written communications with certain information including a legend advising security holders to read the tender offer disclosure statement. We estimate that filers, on average, will file one written communication (in addition to the required information statement) for each cash tender offer transaction. We estimate that a firm's corporate staff will expend approximately 15 burden minutes (0.25 internal burden hours) to file a written communication under the amendments. Based on data from fiscal year 1998, we estimate filers will file 396 full Schedule TOs/year (expending 77.25 internal burden hours/filing) and 309 written communications/year (expending 0.25 internal burden hours/filing).<sup> 298 </sup> On average, filers will require approximately 43.50 internal burden hours to file 705 full Schedule TOs and written communications. In addition, we anticipate filers will spend, at an estimated $175/hour, approximately $40,556/filing in professional labor costs to file a full Schedule TO.<sup> 299 </sup><h>VIII.

10 Regulation of Takeovers and Security Holder Communications, Release No. 33-7607 (November 3, 1998) [63 FR 67331] (the "Proposing Release").

11 The comment letters are available for inspection and copying in our Public Reference Room in File No. S7-28-98. Comments that were submitted electronically also are available on our web site (www.sec.gov).

12 Stock tender offers, also referred to as exchange offers, are tender offers where the consideration offered to security holders includes securities (either equity or debt); these transactions generally are registered under the Securities Act.

13 The term "bidder" is used throughout this release to refer to the offeror or purchaser in a tender offer.

14 For a discussion of the regulatory schemes applicable to cash tender offers, exchange offers, cash and stock mergers, see Part II.A of the Proposing Release.

15 In this release we focus on the amendments that we are adopting and how they differ from the original proposals. For a more complete discussion of the background and rationale for the changes, see the Proposing Release.

16 Securities Act Reform Release, Release No. 33-7606A (November 13,1998) [63 FR 67174].

17 For purposes of this release, the Proposing Release and the rules adopted in this release, a "business combination transaction" means any Rule 145(a) transaction [17 CFR 230.145(a)] (including mergers, recapitalizations, acquisitions, and similar matters) or tender offer (including issuer tender offers).

18 Release No. 33-7759 (October 22, 1999) (the "Cross-Border Adopting Release").

19 The term "target" is used throughout this release to refer to the company to be acquired in a business combination transaction or the company whose securities are the subject of the transaction, whether the transaction is agreed upon or unsolicited.

20 Pub. L. No. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995).

21 Companies may disclose information in response to the market's demand for information regarding proposed transactions and the need to keep customers, employees and other constituencies adequately informed.

22 See Part II.B.1 of the Proposing Release.

23 17 CFR 240.10b-5. We have long recognized the needs of issuers to communicate with security holders regarding important business and financial developments. See Releases No. 33-4697 (May 28, 1964) [29 FR 7317] and 33-5180 (August 16, 1971) [36 FR 16506]. In addition, the Division of Corporation Finance has previously recognized the needs of bidders to disclose information regarding a contemplated "back-end" transaction ( i.e. , a subsequent transaction in which the bidder acquires any remaining securities outstanding). Disclosure of information required by Schedule 14D-1 regarding a "back-end" transaction generally will not result in "gun jumping" because the information is not designed to prime the market for a subsequent registered offering of securities. Instead, the information aids investors in evaluating the terms of a tender offer and deciding whether to tender for cash or wait for securities in a back-end transaction. See Release No. 33-5927 (April 24, 1978) [42 FR 18163].

24 Companies may be required to disclose information under the particular rules of the stock exchange or inter-dealer quotation system upon which their securities are traded.

25 Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b] broadly defines "offer" as including every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security or interest in a security, for value. Offers are currently prohibited during the pre-filing period and restricted during the waiting period.

26 The term "prospectus" is defined in Section 2(a)(10) [15 U.S.C. 77b] to include any prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter of communication, written or by radio or television, that offers any security for sale or confirms the sale of the security, except for communications that are preceded or accompanied by a statutory prospectus.

27 "Solicitation" is broadly defined to include "the furnishing of a form of proxy or other communication to security holders under circumstances reasonably calculated to result in the procurement, withholding or revocation of a proxy." See Rule 14a-1( l ) [17 CFR 240.14a-1( l )].

28 The Williams Act provides that only very limited information can be announced without either commencing a cash tender offer or requiring the filing of a registration statement in a stock offer. See Rule 14d-2(c) and (d) [17 CFR 240.14d-2(c) and (d)].

29 The Williams Act was enacted in 1968 as an amendment to the Exchange Act (Sections 13(d)-(e) and 14(d)-(f)). The Williams Act regulates tender offers and imposes beneficial ownership reporting requirements. 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)-(e) and 15 U.S.C. 78n(d)-(f).

30 Our exemptions permitting earlier communications do not in any way alter the liability traditionally imposed on insider trading. See Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 [17 CFR 240.14e-3]. Rule 14e-3 applies when a person "has taken a substantial step or steps to commence, or has commenced, a tender offer," so the timing of this rule is not affected by the new regulatory scheme.

31 The new rules only provide an exemption from Section 5 (and comparable restrictions on communications under the proxy and tender offer rules). Oral communications under the new rules, like written communications, will have liability under the applicable regulatory scheme. See Part II.B.2 below.

32 Chairman Levitt has expressed concerns about the selective disclosure of material information to analysts and institutional investors. See "A Question of Integrity: Promoting Investor Confidence by Fighting Insider Trading," speech given Feb. 27, 1998, available on our web site (www.sec.gov).

33 See "Quality Information: The Lifeblood of Our Markets" speech given by Chairman Levitt on Oct. 18, 1999, available on our web site (www.sec.gov). "The behind-the-scenes feeding of material non-public information from companies to analysts is a stain on our markets. This selectiveness is a disservice to investors and it undermines the fundamental principle of fairness. In a time when instantaneous and free flowing information is the norm, these sort of whispers are an insult to fair and public disclosure. . . . [T]he Commission is planning to take action where it can. Within the next few months, we will consider proposing rules to close the gap between those in the so-called `know' and the rest of us in the public."

34 We solicited comment on two alternatives to our primary communications proposal that were not favored by commenters and are not being adopted.

35 The exemptions also apply to communications made after the mandated disclosure document is filed, so long as written communications are filed. They do not, however, alter the disclosure, filing and delivery requirements for the mandated disclosure documents.

36 15 U.S.C. 78j(b). The communications permitted under the exemptions adopted would be subject to liability under the particular regulatory scheme (the Securities Act, proxy or tender offer rules) as well as Rule 10b-5 and the other antifraud rules.

37 Written communications include all information disseminated otherwise than orally, including electronic communications and other future applications of changing technology. Videos and CD-ROMs, for example, should be filed on EDGAR by means of a transcript. See Rule 304 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.304].

38 The legend also would advise investors that they can obtain copies of the filed documents for free at the Commission's web site and explain which documents are available for free from the issuer or filing person, as applicable. See new Rule 165(c)(1) and revised Rules 14a-12(a)(1)(ii), 13e-4(c), 14d-2(b)(2), and 14d-9(a).

39 We did not propose, and are not adopting, a requirement to deliver written communications to security holders.

40 These communications must be filed on EDGAR to the same extent that the related prospectus, proxy statement or tender offer statement must be filed on EDGAR.

41 17 CFR 232.13(d). See Part II.C.3 below.

42 See Part II.B.2 below.

43 Oral communications are covered by the exemptions, but they do not need to be reduced to writing or filed. Oral communications, as proposed, will be subject to liability under the applicable regulatory scheme. For example, pre-filing oral communications regarding a proposed offering of securities in connection with a business combination transaction will be subject to Section 12(a)(2) liability. See Part II.B.2 below.

44 Cf. Rule 14a-6(c) [17 CFR 240.14a-6(c)] and Item 1016(g) of Regulation M-A.

45 At this time we are not adopting proposed Rules 168 and 169, the exemptions for regularly released forward-looking information and factual business communications from the filing requirements. See Part VII.A.1.c.ii.(A) and (B) of the Securities Act Reform Release and Release No. 33-5009 (Oct. 7, 1969) [34 FR 16870]. Although we are not adopting these rules, we do not expect parties to file ordinary or routine business communications that refer to the transaction in a non-substantive way.

46 If the same written communication is redisseminated or contains only minimal changes ( e.g. , correction of minor typographical errors, an update regarding a contact person, or stylistic changes including a change in the format, type-size, letterhead, addressee, etc.) without any change to the content of the information, the written communication would not need to be refiled. In addition, we do not expect persons to file responses to specific unsolicited inquiries if the responses are not disseminated to others. Of course, if a response to an unsolicited inquiry contained material information not otherwise available to the investing public ( e.g. , projections), the communication would need to be filed.

47 Section 28 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77z-3] gives us authority to, by rule or regulation, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of this title or any rule or regulation issued under this title to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with protection of investors.

48 We adopt proposed Securities Act Rules 165, 166 and 167 as new Rules 165(b), 165(a) and 166, respectively. These rules are limited to business combination transactions since the Securities Act Reform Release proposals governing capital-raising transactions are not being adopted at this time.

49 In the Securities Act Reform Release, we proposed a requirement that all "free writing" materials be filed as prospectus supplements in accordance with Rule 425. In this release, we adopt proposed Rule 425(b) and (c) as new Rule 425(a) and (b) and limit the rule to business combination transactions. Proposed paragraph (a) contained several exceptions from the filing requirement. We retain the exceptions that are still applicable in Rule 425(d).

50 See Part II.B.3 below discussing revised Rules 135 and 145 in greater detail.

51 See Part II.B.4 below for the definition of public announcement.

52 See Part II.A.3 above discussing the types of written communications that must be filed. Written communications relating to the transaction before the filing of a registration statement are prospectuses that must be filed under Rule 425. See new Rule 165(a). After a registration statement is filed (during what is called the "waiting period"), and after effectiveness of the registration statement, written communications relating to the transaction are prospectuses that must be filed under Rule 425. See new Rule 165(b). Communications filed under Rule 425 do not need to be delivered to security holders. This does not, however, change the prospectus delivery requirements for the mandated prospectus that is part of the registration statement, and any supplements either before or after the registration statement is declared effective. These prospectuses and supplements would continue to be delivered to security holders and filed under Rule 424 [17 CFR 230.424] instead of Rule 425.

53 A communication that contains no more information than that specified in Rule 135 will not be an offer, as is currently the case.

54 We note, however, that a communication relating to an investment company that is permitted by the new and amended rules generally would have omitted to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements in the communication not materially misleading unless the communication includes the information specified in Rule 34b-1 [17 CFR 270.34b-1] under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [17 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq .]

55 New Rule 166 provides that communications before the first public announcement of a transaction will not be offers, so long as parties to the transaction take reasonable steps to prevent further distribution or publication until the first public announcement or the registration statement is filed.

56 For example, the exemption would not be available where a non-reporting issuer conducts an exchange offer primarily for the purposes of giving its investors freely tradable securities and creating a public market in, or manipulating the market for, those securities. Likewise, it would be inappropriate to rely on the exemptions in effecting a merger of a public "shell" company to take a private company public. These mergers commonly are used to develop a market for the merged entity's securities, often as part of a scheme to manipulate the market for those securities.

57 Of course, if a communication contains material information, that information must be disclosed in the registration statement that is declared effective. Therefore, the information ultimately will be subject to Section 11 liability [15 U.S.C. 77k] as well.

58 In some cases, these communications are filed and incorporated by reference into registration statements, and as a result also are subject to Section 11 liability.

59 New Rule 165(e). This provision is similar to the good faith standard in Rule 508(a) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.508(a)]. Although an immaterial or unintentional failure to file or delay in filing is a violation of the filing requirement, it would not render the exemption unavailable. Factors to be considered in determining whether a delay in filing is immaterial or unintentional include: the nature of the information, the length of the delay, and the surrounding circumstances, including whether a bona fide effort was made to file timely. If a written communication is made late in the day and the offeror attempts to file it, but experiences difficulty in filing electronically on EDGAR, and files as soon as practicable after business hours or the following business day, the exemption will continue to be available.

60 15 U.S.C. 77e. Rule 135 generally permits prospective offerors to issue notices that include the following information: (1) the name of the issuer; (2) the title, amount and basic terms of the securities to be offered, the amount of the offering, if any, by selling security holders, the anticipated time of the offering, and a brief statement of the manner and purpose of the offering, without naming the underwriters; and (3) any statement or legend required by state law. Other limited information also is permitted under the rule for rights offerings, exchange offers and offers to employees of the issuer or an affiliate.

61 Cash tender offers and cash mergers do not involve the Securities Act, and thus no reliance on Rule 135 is necessary.

62 Rule 145 is the rule that applies the registration requirements to business combinations involving security holder voting decisions. Rule 145(b)(1) provides that written communications containing only specified information about mergers and similar transactions are not deemed offers or a prospectus. Rule 135(a)(4) contains a similar provision for communications about exchange offers. Rule 145(b)(2), which provides that certain communications subject to the proxy rules are not offers, is being rescinded as proposed.

63 Changes to Rules 135 and 145 in the Securities Act Reform Release that were specifically tailored to capital-raising transactions are not being adopted at this time.

64 17 CFR 249.308.

65 New Rule 425(b).

66 New Rule 165(f)(3). A similar definition of "public announcement" is included in revised Rules 13e-4(c) and 14d-2(b).

67 Of course, if the regulations of the self-regulatory organization on which the securities are listed require a public announcement of the transaction, that would constitute a public announcement for purposes of the communications exemptions.

68 The expansion of Rule 14a-12 to cover all solicitations eliminates the need for many of the provisions in Rule 14a-11. As a result, we are rescinding Rule 14a-11 and moving paragraphs (d) and (f) of Rule 14a-11 to new Rule 14a-12. These two provisions apply if soliciting persons refer to information in annual reports or use reprints or reproductions of previously published materials in their soliciting materials. Revised Rule 14a-12 makes it clear that these provisions are limited to election contests.

69 Written communications by soliciting parties before a proxy statement is furnished to security holders must be filed on the date of first use and must provide information regarding the participants and their interests or include a legend advising security holders where they can obtain this information. See revised Rule 14a-12(a)(1). Once a proxy statement is furnished to security holders, any additional soliciting materials used must be filed on the date of first use but need not include participant information or a legend advising where to obtain that information. See revised Rule 14a-6(b).

70 Communications under revised Rule 14a-12 generally will be filed under cover of the proxy statement cover sheet, with the Rule 14a-12 box checked. If a transaction is subject to the Securities Act in addition to one or more of the other regulatory schemes ( i.e. , the proxy or tender offer rules), the written communications only need to be filed under Securities Act Rule 425. Although the materials are only filed under the Securities Act, they also would be deemed filed and take liability under the proxy or tender offer rules, as applicable.

71 Similarly, the revised rule does not change a security holder's obligation under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78m(d)] to file or amend a Schedule 13D [17 CFR 240.13d-101] when a voting arrangement, agreement or understanding is reached with respect to a company's securities.

72 17 CFR 240.14a-9.

73 We note that a communication relating to an investment company that is permitted by Rule 14a-12 generally would have omitted to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements in the communication not materially misleading unless the communication includes the information specified in Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

74 Revised Rule 14a-12(a)(2).

75 For example, in Part II.D.1 below, we are revising the definition of commencement in the tender offer rules so that a complete tender offer statement need not be filed and disseminated until the means to tender are provided to security holders.

76 In response to our question asking whether to retain the requirement to disclose the names of all participants and their interests, several commenters expressed the view that the requirement has resulted in lengthy and boilerplate disclosure that can be costly for participants without providing any significant benefit for security holders.

77 The information must be filed under cover of Schedule 14A with the appropriate box on the cover page checked to designate that the material is filed under Rule 14a-12.

78 Rule 14a-6(e)(2) [17 CFR 240.14a-6(e)(2)].

79 Rule 135 generally exempts from the definition of "offer" any notice that states no more than specific limited information; see n.60 above. The Rule 135 limit on communications would apply to all parties to the transaction and anyone acting on their behalf in communicating to the public.

80 Revised Rules 14a-6(e)(2) and 14c-5(c)(2). Confidential treatment will continue to be unavailable for going-private or roll-up transactions.

81 17 CFR 240.14a-6(b).

82 See Rules 14a-4(f) [17 CFR 240.14a-4(f)], 14a-6(c) [17 CFR 240.14a-6(c)], 14a-11(c) [17 CFR 240.14a-11(c)], 14a-12(b) [17 CFR 240.14a-12(b)] and 14c-5(b) [17 CFR 240.14c-5(b)].

83 See Rule 101(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.101(a)(1)(iii)]. Paper filings are permitted only if a hardship exemption is available. Foreign private issuers that are not required to file electronically are exempt from the proxy and information statement requirements. Exchange Act Rule 3a-12-3 [17 CFR 240.3a-12-3].

84 We also are adopting the proposed clarification to Rule 13(d) of Regulation S-T. The revised rule makes it clear that if a communication takes place after our official business hours ( i.e. , 5:30 p.m. Eastern time) or on a non-business day, the communication must be filed electronically on EDGAR the following business day. This revision supersedes the interpretive position expressed by the Division of Corporation Finance in Henry Lesser, Esq. (November 28, 1995). This provision applies to all our rules that require filing on the same date that information is furnished, including the Securities Act, proxy and tender offer rules.

85 Currently, an offer is deemed to "commence" on public announcement of the following limited information: the identity of the bidder, the identity of the subject company, the amount and class of securities sought and the price or range of prices offered, unless a tender offer statement is filed within five business days of the announcement and disseminated to security holders or the bidder makes a subsequent public announcement withdrawing the offer. See Rule 14d-2(b) and (c) [17 CFR 240.14d-2(b) and (c)]. We refer to this as the "five business day rule."

86 Although third-party bidders offering cash or exempt securities must file a tender offer statement within five business days, bidders offering registered securities are not bound by the same rule. They must file a registration statement relating to the securities offered "promptly" after announcing the limited information specified in Rule 135. See Rule 14d-2(e) 17 CFR 240.14d-2(e)].

87 If the target company comments on the merits of an offer or otherwise makes a recommendation with respect to an offer, it may be required to file a disclosure document. See Rule 14d-9(a) [17 CFR 240.14d-9(a)].

88 Revised Rule 14d-2(c). Rule 13e-4 has no comparable communications restrictions, but we are adopting changes to this rule to conform it to the new communications scheme.

89 The public announcement also triggers the Rule 14e-5 restrictions on purchasing outside the tender offer, as discussed in Part II.G.5 below.

90 Revised Rule 14d-2(b)(2). These communications will be filed under cover of Schedule TO or 14D-9, as appropriate. Both schedules have a box to check indicating that these are pre-commencement communications. No signature is required. See General Instruction D to Schedule TO and General Instruction B to Schedule 14D-9. If the transaction also is subject to the Securities Act, then communications must be filed under Rule 425 only, and those communications will be deemed filed under the tender offer rules.

91 Generally, this will occur if the bidder provides security holders with a transmittal form to use to tender securities or if the bidder publishes an advertisement advising security holders how to tender in the offer or to contact the bidder for more information on how to tender securities in the offer. This also would occur if by some other means persons are able to tender securities to the bidder. At that time, the bidder must file and disseminate the tender offer schedule, and the required 20 business day period that all tender offers must remain open will begin to run. Revised Rule 14d-2(a).

92 Although we are changing how a tender offer is commenced for purposes of the tender offer rules, we are not defining the term "tender offer" or changing our position on what activities may be deemed to constitute a tender offer. The tender offer rules still may apply to activities that function as unconventional tender offers. We maintain our position that the term "tender offer" should be interpreted flexibly in accordance with the intended purposes of Sections 14(d) and 14(e). A determination of whether a particular transaction or series of transactions constitutes a tender offer will, of course, depend on the particular facts and circumstances and is not limited to "conventional" tender offers. See Release No. 34-15548 (Feb. 5, 1979) [44 FR 9956].

93 This is not intended to change how bidders legitimately finance their offers today. Bidders may have sufficient funds on hand to complete the offer or they may arrange to borrow funds from an outside source. In most cases when the bidder expects to obtain funds from another source, financing is arranged in advance or immediately after announcing an offer. Bidders typically get a commitment letter from their lenders.

94 See Part II.B.7.a of the Proposing Release and Release No. 34-15548 (February 5, 1979) [44 FR 9956].

95 We have not observed any disruptive or destabilizing effects in cases where pre-commencement publicity is currently permitted, such as where Rule 135 information is disclosed regarding a proposed exchange offer more than five business days before a registration statement is filed.

96 Issuer tender offers are subject to Rule 13e-4, which does not contain a comparable provision to the five business day rule or a requirement to file a registration statement promptly after announcing limited information about a registered exchange offer.

97 Bidders often wait until the fifth business day following public announcement before filing a full tender offer statement in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a) [17 CFR 14d-3(a)]. In addition, it can take several days before mailed copies of the tender offer statement are received by beneficial owners. Bidders offering registered securities must promptly file the registration statement after announcement, which in most cases is more than five business days after the announcement.

98 All tender offers must remain open for at least 20 business days. See Rule 14e-1(a) [17 CFR 240.14e-1(a)]. If security holders are willing to wait to receive the tender offer statement containing the required information, they can consider the disclosure document in light of all earlier communications relating to the transactions before making an investment decision with respect to the offer. We have no reason to believe that the current minimum time period for tender offers is inadequate.

99 See Dynamics Corp. of America v. CTS Corp. , 481 U.S. 69, 79 (1987).

100 See , e.g. , Barnett Bank of Marion County v. Nelson , 517 U.S. 25 (1996) (summarizing preemption principles); see also Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assoc. v. de la Cuesta , 458 U.S. 141, 154 (1982).

101 Revised Rule 14d-9. These communications must include a legend similar to the one required on the bidder's pre-commencement communications, advising security holders to read the complete recommendation when it is available. Although we did not propose such a legend, we solicited comment on it, and the commenters who addressed the issue supported a legend requirement.

102 See Rule 14e-2(a) [17 CFR 240.14e-2(a)].

103 See Part II.B.7.b of the Proposing Release.

104 Rule 14d-2(a)(1) [17 CFR 240.14d-2(a)(2)].

105 A bidder must publish the information specified in Rule 14d-6(e)(1) [17 CFR 240.14d-6(e)(1)].

106 Not all security holders have access to the Internet. Even those that do have access would not have notice that a tender offer for their company's securities was posted on a web site. All commenters who addressed the question opposed electronic dissemination as the sole means to disseminate an offer, noting that there are no electronic sources of information as commonly available and widely followed as newspapers. Of course, it is permissible to post tender offer materials on a web site in addition to using other methods of dissemination. Electronic media also may be used to satisfy requirements to deliver tender offer material in accordance with our guidelines for electronic delivery. See Release No. 33-7233 (October 6, 1995) [60 FR 53458]. For example, a summary advertisement for a tender offer could contain a consent form for security holders to indicate their willingness to receive the complete tender offer materials by means of a specified electronic medium.

107 Rule 14d-6(a)(2) [17 CFR 240.14d-6(a)(2)].

108 Similarly, we are retaining the current requirement that bidders using stockholder lists also publish summary advertisements.

109 We are amending Rule 14d-6(a)(2) to delete the language limiting the information that can appear in a summary advertisement. We are retaining the prohibition against including a transmittal form with the summary advertisement. A summary advertisement may (and must, if it is designed to commence the offer) include the means to tender, e.g. , a telephone number to call to obtain the complete tender offer materials, including the transmittal form.

110 Rule 14d-3(a)(2). The current rule also requires telephonic notice and mailing of tender offer material to any securities exchange or the NASD on which the securities are listed or traded. We are not extending this delivery requirement to pre-commencement communications because the exchanges and the NASD are relying less on paper filings and more on electronic databases to obtain EDGAR filings.

111 Communications regarding offers can be made without a summary advertisement of the offer appearing in newspapers.

112 As proposed, this requirement would have been triggered by the first communication setting forth specified information. We believe, however, that it will be simpler for bidders to know that this obligation will attach at the same time the first pre-commencement communication is filed. Once target companies and other bidders receive notice of the transaction, they can monitor the Commission's filings for subsequent pre-commencement materials.

113 Revised Rule 14d-2(b)(2). Instead of hand delivery, the rule only requires "delivery," so the bidder may use any other means of delivery that is equally prompt and equally likely to receive the attention of the target company ( e.g. , an e-mail to the corporate secretary, chief executive officer and other persons of similar authority at the target company, where the target company uses these e-mail addresses for public communications). We have similarly modified the bidder's current obligation to hand deliver a copy of the mandated disclosure document. See revised Rule 14d-3(a)(2).

114 See Rule 14d-2(a)(4). Commencement occurs when definitive copies of the prospectus/tender offer material are first published, sent or given to security holders.

115 As a result, the 20 business day period that a tender offer must remain open typically begins to run earlier for cash offers than stock offers. See Rule 14e-1(a).

116 The latter group was primarily concerned that staff comment could necessitate the dissemination of a post-effective amendment.

117 These commenters also urged us to extend early commencement to going-private transactions as well. We do not believe going-private transactions warrant early commencement, especially in light of the numerous comments issued by the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance that result in significant changes to the disclosure. Therefore, we are not extending early commencement to Rule 13e-3 transactions. In addition, as proposed, early commencement is not available to roll-up transactions. A roll-up transaction is any transaction or series of transactions that directly or indirectly, through acquisition or otherwise, involves the combination or reorganization of one or more "finite-life" entities (usually limited partnerships) where the securities to be issued are registered under the Securities Act. See Release No. 33-6900 (June 17, 1991) [56 FR 28979]; Release No. 33-6922 (October 30, 1991) [56 FR 57237]; Release No. 33-7113 (December 1, 1994) [59 FR 63676]; and the 900 series of Regulation S-K.

118 Rule 14a-4(f).

119 Rule 14e-1(a).

120 Most state corporate laws require that notice of a meeting be sent to security holders no less than 10 days and no more than 60 days before the meeting.

121 See Part II.C.1 above.

122 See Part II.E.2 below discussing appropriate time periods for the dissemination of a prospectus supplement containing materials changes.

123 New Rule 162 and revised Rules 13e-4(e)(2) and 14d-4(b).

124 If the registration statement as first filed does not contain a prospectus with this information, the bidder may file a pre-effective amendment to supply the requisite information and then commence the offer.

125 We are not changing our current position regarding the level of information necessary to adequately inform security holders of the consideration offered; the pricing information required is the same information that would be required in an effective registration statement today. Often, in a business combination transaction the consideration offered to security holders is based on a formula pricing mechanism that is based on the market price of either the target or the bidder's securities during a specified period. The requirement to provide pricing information in a prospectus that is delivered to security holders to commence an exchange offer would be satisfied if all material elements of the formula are described in sufficient detail so that security holders can evaluate the offer. A fixed price is not required under early commencement.

126 Rule 430 and 430A [17 CFR 230.430 and 430A].

127 Because tender offer statements generally incorporate by reference a substantial amount of the required information from the related registration statement, the actual filing of a tender offer statement would serve primarily as notice to us and the markets that the exchange offer commenced. Of course, any prospectus furnished to security holders before the registration statement is effective must include the red herring legend required by Item 501(b)(10) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.501(b)(10)].

128 Regulation M [17 CFR 242.100 through 242.105] prohibits purchases of the bidder's securities during an exchange offer's restricted period, beginning when the bidder commences its offer. The restrictions under Rule 10b-13 (new Rule 14e-5) start when the bidder makes its first public announcement.

129 Rule 162, as adopted, is extended to issuer exchange offers subject to Rule 13e-4 as well as third-party exchange offers subject to Regulation 14D [17 CFR 240.14d-1 through 17 CFR 240.14d-101].

130 This exemption is necessary to prevent the tendering of securities into an offer from being viewed as a "sale" without an effective registration statement. We are using our exemptive authority under Section 28 of the Securities Act to adopt this new rule.

131 Rule 14e-1(b) [17 CFR 240.14e-1(b)]. A tender offer must remain open for ten business days after a notice of an increase or decrease in the percentage of the class of securities being sought, the consideration offered, or the dealer's soliciting fee.

132 See Release No. 34-24296 (April 3, 1987) [52 FR 11458].

133 Revised Rules 14d-4(b) and (d) and 13e-4(e). This approach was favored by all commenters who addressed the issue.

134 The 20 business day period required by the tender offer rules will not begin to run if the prospectus disseminated to security holders is materially deficient. For example, if the initial prospectus does not comply with the roll-up rules, the minimum solicitation period under the roll-up rules will not begin until a revised prospectus satisfying the roll-up rules is disseminated.

135 17 CFR 240.14e-1 through 17 CFR 240.14e-8.

136 Any supplements sent to security holders should present the informational changes in a clear, concise and understandable manner. See Rule 421 of Regulation C [17 CFR 230.421]. If there are a number of changes necessitating the delivery of several supplements, offerors should consider the need to give security holders a complete unified document containing all changes and updates in a revised preliminary or final prospectus.

137 Section 28 of the Securities Act.

138 See new Rule 162(b), which provides an exemption from Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(2)]. This rule does not provide an exemption for exchange offers that commence on the date of effectiveness or later, for which a final prospectus must be delivered to security holders. In the Securities Act Reform Release we proposed to eliminate the requirement to deliver a final prospectus for certain capital-raising transactions, but not business combination transactions. See proposed Rule 173 and Part VIII.C.3.b of the Securities Act Reform Release.

139 17 CFR 240.15c2-8(d). This rule requires all brokers or dealers that participate in a distribution of securities registered under the Securities Act to take reasonable steps to comply promptly with the written request of any person for a copy of the final prospectus. The broker or dealer must comply with this request until the expiration of the applicable 40-day or 90-day period under Section 4(3) of the Act. 15 U.S.C. 77(d)(3). See Rule 174 [17 CFR 230.174].

140 Schedules 13E-4, 14D-1 and 13E-3, respectively.

141 One commenter urged us to codify the availability of a procedure for making acquisitions using securities registered on an acquisition shelf registration statement. While we are not codifying this procedure as part of this release, we remind offerors that the procedure continues to be available. See Form S-4, General Instruction H, and Service Corporation International (December 2, 1985).

142 The format and instructions for Schedules 13E-3 and 14D-9 are revised so that they are consistent with new Schedule TO. These schedules refer to Regulation M-A for all substantive disclosure requirements. We did not propose, and are not adopting, any changes to the schedules used in connection with the multijurisdictional disclosure system for Canadian issuers (Schedules 13E-4F, 14D-1F and 14D-9F) [17 CFR 240.13e-102; 17 CFR 240.14d-102; 17 CFR 240.14d-103].

143 New Schedule TO has boxes on the cover page to check to indicate whether the filing is an issuer tender offer, third-party tender offer, and/or going-private transaction. We are implementing conforming changes to the EDGAR filing tag system so that the type of transaction and filing persons are identified when viewing a document on EDGAR.

144 For example, an affiliate engaged in a tender offer having a going-private effect can now file a Schedule TO that also serves as a Schedule 13E-3. All filing persons and applicable schedules must be identified on the cover page. Separate cover pages are not required. Of course, a Schedule 13E-3 must be filed independently when the underlying transaction is not a tender offer.

145 Schedule TO also may be combined with an amendment to a previously filed Schedule 13D. See General Instruction G to Schedule TO. The ability to file a joint 13D amendment and tender offer statement is the same as currently permitted. See General Instruction E to Schedule 14D-1.

146 General Instruction J to new Schedule TO.

147 Documents filed electronically on EDGAR are readily available to security holders and the public ( e.g. , through the Internet, our public reference room, brokers and investment advisors). This change also applies to going-private statements.

148 General Instruction E to new Schedules TO and revised Schedule 13E-3 and General Instruction C to revised Schedule 14D-9.

149 See current Rules 14d-6(e), 14d-9(c), 13e-3(e) and 13e-4(d) specifying the information that must be summarized or included in the disclosure document sent to security holders.

150 Revised Rules 14d-6(d), 14d-9(d), 13e-3(e) and 13e-4(d).

151 Items 7, 8 and 9 of current and revised Schedule 13E-3.

152 For example, negative or "not applicable" responses or information that goes beyond what is summarized in the disclosure document must be disclosed under the appropriate item number in the schedule if not included in the disclosure document sent to security holders.

153 See General Instructions E and F to new Schedule TO and revised Schedule 13E-3 and General Instructions C and D to revised Schedule 14D-9. We are eliminating the requirement in General Instruction F of current Schedule 13E-3 to provide a cross-reference sheet showing where the responses are located.

154 Item 1001 of Regulation M-A. For purposes of this requirement, plain English has the same meaning as in Rule 421(b) and (d).

155 If a transaction is subject both to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and either Rule 13e-3 or the tender offer rules, a plain English summary term sheet is not required. See Item 1 of revised Schedule 13E-3 [17 CFR 240.13e-100] and new Schedule TO [17 CFR 240.14d-100].

156 See Item 3 of Forms S-4 and F-4 and Rule 421(d) of Regulation C [17 CFR 230.421(d)]. Effectiveness of a registration statement may be denied or a stop order issued when there has not been a bona fide effort to present information in a reasonably clear, concise and readable manner. See Rule 461(b)(1) of Regulation C [17 CFR 230.461(b)(1)]; see also , In the Matter of Franchard Corporation , 42 S.E.C. 163 (1964).

157 The required summary term sheet should present information in bullet-point format and may include cross-references to more detailed information found elsewhere in the disclosure documents provided to security holders, consistent with plain English principles.

158 See current and revised Item 9 to Schedule 13E-3.

159 17 CFR 240.14a-101. Item 14 disclosure is required when a vote or consent is solicited on: (i) a merger; (ii) a consolidation; (iii) the acquisition of assets, a business or securities; (v) the sale or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the registrant; (vi) a liquidation; or (vii) a dissolution. This item requires information about the transaction and each party to the transaction ( i.e. , the acquiror and the target). The information specified in Item 14 may be incorporated by reference or physically included in the disclosure document depending on the extent to which the acquiror or target is eligible to use Form S-2 or S-3.

160 New Item 14(d) of Schedule 14A. We believe that this will be simpler for investment companies than referring to Forms S-4 and F-4, which generally are inapplicable to investment companies. We also have consolidated and conformed current Instructions 6 and 8 to Item 14 for investment companies. Instruction to paragraph (d) of Item 14 of Schedule 14A. The requirements that we are retaining for investment companies were not specifically tailored for investment companies, and we believe that it would be appropriate to reconsider these requirements in a future rulemaking project focused on the registration and disclosure requirements applicable to investment company business combination transactions.

161 Revised Instruction 2(a) to Item 14 of Schedule 14A. Pro forma information about the transaction is not generally required in a cash merger where only the target's security holders are voting on the transaction.

162 Even if the acquiror's security holders are voting, acquiror information may be omitted because the acquiror's security holders are presumed to have access to information about their own company. In this case, pro forma information about the transaction will still be required in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.11-01 through 17 CFR 210.11-03].

163 Revised Item 14(c)(1) to Schedule 14A. If financial statements of the target are required, then three years of financial statements must be provided, consistent with the other requirements for financial statements of acquired companies.

164 Revised Instruction 2(b) to Item 14 of Schedule 14A.

165 No target information is required if target security holders are voting on a merger in which the consideration offered consists of acquiror securities that are exempt from Securities Act registration. Revised Instruction 3 to Item 14 of Schedule 14A.

166 See Note D.3 to Schedule 14A; General Instruction A.2 to Form S-4; and General Instruction A.2 to Form F-4.

167 We have stated that the 20 business day period must be complied with even if the documents incorporated by reference are delivered along with the disclosure document. See Release No. 33-6578 (April 23, 1985) [50 FR 18990] (Form S-4 adopting release). We are changing this interpretation. If filers furnish the information that is incorporated by reference with the disclosure document that is sent to security holders, they do not have to comply with the 20 business day requirement.

168 Revised Item 14(e) to Schedule 14A [17 CFR 240.14a-101].

169 See Item 17(b)(7) of Form S-4, Item 17(b)(5) of Form F-4 and Item 14(b)(3)(ii)(A) of Schedule 14A. These items specify the information required for non-reporting target companies in a business combination transaction. An acquiror must provide financial statements "that would have been required to be included in an annual report to security holders" had the non-reporting company been required to furnish an annual report that complies with Rule 14a-3(b) [17 CFR 240.14a-3(b)]. This rule requires audited balance sheets for each of the two most recent fiscal years and audited statements of income and cash flows for each of the three most recent fiscal years prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X.

170 The required balance sheet for the year preceding the latest full fiscal year and the income statements for the two years preceding the latest full fiscal year need not be audited if they have not previously been audited. The required financial statements must be audited to the extent practicable.

171 Since we are not adopting Forms C and SB-3, these changes are implemented in amendments to Forms S-4 and F-4.

172 Determination of the significance of an acquisition to the acquiror is made in accordance with Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-05]. See Release No. 33-7355 (October 10, 1996) [61 FR 54509] and Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.1-02(w)].

173 This change is consonant with our revisions to Item 14 to eliminate the requirement to provide target financial statements in cash mergers when the acquiror's security holders are not voting on the transaction and the information is not material to the target security holders' voting decision.

174 In Release No. 33-7355, we streamlined the requirements with respect to financial statements for business acquisitions. Among other things, the amended rules raised the thresholds of significance that determine whether financial statements of an acquired business must be provided in filings. These rule changes were intended to reduce impediments to registered offerings that may have caused companies to undertake private or offshore offerings instead. We believe the significance threshold for non-reporting targets should be the same in Forms S-4 and F-4 as under our other financial statement requirements. We may, however, consider revisiting this issue in a broader context in a future rulemaking proposal that addresses what the significance thresholds should be in light of the current accounting environment.

175 These changes do not affect the financial statements required in roll-up transactions.

176 Revised Items 17(b)(7) of Form S-4 and 17(b)(5) of Form F-4.

177 Under these facts pro forma and comparative per share information is not required. See Rule 11-01(c) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.11-01(c)].

178 At a minimum, however, a narrative description of the material variations in accounting principles, practices and methods used in preparing the foreign GAAP financial statements from those accepted in the U.S. is required.

179 A resale registration statement is used to register the resale of securities to the public by anyone who is deemed an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c) with respect to the securities being re-offered.

180 As proposed, we are adopting a technical change to Rule 432, which requires the prospectus disseminated to security holders in connection with an exchange offer to include certain information specified by the tender offer rules. The revised rule also clarifies that the requirement includes issuer tender offers. See current Rule 13e-4(d)(iv). The requirement is moved to revised Rule 432.

181 See Memorandum of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amicus Curiae, at 2, Harris v. Ivax Corp. , No. 98-4818 (11th Cir. Aug. 1999) (partially supporting a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc in Harris v. Ivax Corp. , 182 F.3d 799 (11th Cir. 1999)).

182 See Release No. 34-24296 (April 3, 1987) [52 FR 11458].

183 If a bidder announces a subsequent offering period and later decides not to provide the period, clearly this would be a material change in the offer's terms that must be disclosed in advance as provided in Release No. 34-24296. Commenters did not disagree with this view.

184 We also are amending Rule 14d-7 to provide an exemption so the withdrawal rights required by Section 14(d)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(d)(5)], which apply 60 days after the start of a tender offer, are not available during a subsequent offering period.

185 The subsequent offering period may not be used if payment will be delayed for any reason. In the past we have stated that payment may be delayed for certain governmental regulatory approvals. See Release No. 34-16623 (March 5, 1980) [45 FR 15521]. A subsequent offering period, however, cannot be used unless all conditions to payment have been satisfied or waived and the bidder pays for all securities tendered in the initial offering period promptly after the close of the initial offering period. Likewise, there cannot be any conditions to the offer during the subsequent offering period.

186 New Rule 14d-11(e) and revised Rule 14e-1(c).

187 If a bidder offers cash and securities with a limit on the amount of cash or securities that may be paid to security holders, then a subsequent offering period may not be used. The imposition of a cap on one or the other form of consideration could result in proration which, as discussed in the Proposing Release, is why we limited the subsequent offering period to offers for all outstanding securities.

188 The initial and subsequent offering periods are all part of one tender offer. If a different price were paid to security holders it would violate the all-holders best-price rules as well as the subsequent offering period rule. See new Rule 14d-11(f), current Rule 14d-10(a)(2) and Release No. 34-23421 (July 11, 1986) [51 FR 25873].

189 In response to a question in the Proposing Release, two commenters favored such a requirement.

190 17 CFR 240.14e-1(d). For example, if a bidder elects to provide a three business day subsequent offering period, and later determines that a longer period is necessary, the bidder could extend the subsequent offering period by up to 17 business days. The bidder would, of course, need to announce the extension no later than 9:00 a.m. on the fourth business day after the initial offering period closed, and the total duration of the subsequent offering period could not exceed twenty business days.

191 If a bidder offers securities instead of or in addition to cash, then financial statements are material. The registration statement form for the securities offered will specify the financial statements required. If the bidder offers securities that are exempt from registration, the financial statements specified in Schedule TO would be filed.

192 Item 9 of Schedule 14D-1 and Item 7 of Schedule 13E-4.

193 Instruction 1 to Item 9 of Schedule 14D-1.

194 Rules 14d-6(e) [17 CFR 240.14d-6] and 13e-4(d) [17 CFR 240.13e-4(d)].

195 Financial information can be material when a bidder seeks to acquire the entire equity interest of the target and the bidder's ability to finance the transaction is uncertain. Financial information also can be material when a bidder seeks to acquire a significant equity stake in order to influence the management and affairs of the target. In the latter case, security holders need financial information for the prospective controlling security holder to decide whether to tender in the offer or remain a continuing security holder in a company with a dominant or controlling security holder.

196 Release No. 34-13787 (July 21, 1977) [42 FR 38341].

197 We are not changing bidders' ability to incorporate by reference financial information into their tender offer materials. See Instruction 3 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO.

198 Although proposed Item 10 to Schedule TO did not specifically address the need to provide financial information for a controlling entity that forms an entity for the purpose of making a tender offer, we have revised Item 10 consistent with the requirements currently in Item 9 to Schedule 14D-1. If a bidder is formed by a controlling person for the purpose of making an offer, then financial information for the parent must be provided.

199 Instruction 2 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO.

200 The same analysis applies for non-reporting bidders, such as private investors, partnerships or private equity funds. These private bidders often finance their tender offers with funds raised from limited partners through a process known as a "capital call." If the private bidder's offer is conditioned on obtaining funds from limited partners, security holders or other members of the entity, the offer is deemed subject to a financing condition.

201 Rule 100(a) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.100].

202 17 CFR 249.220f.

203 This prong of the instruction will not be deemed satisfied if the bidder's financial statement information is not available on the EDGAR system ( e.g. , because the bidder is delinquent in its reporting obligations or the bidder has filed this information in paper under a hardship exemption).

204 To the extent financial statements of a foreign bidder are required and are prepared under foreign GAAP, a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP is required unless a reconciliation is unavailable or not otherwise obtainable without unreasonable cost or expense. As noted above in Part II.F.2.c, bidders must provide, at a minimum, a narrative description of the material variations in accounting principles, practices and methods used in preparing the foreign GAAP financial statements from those accepted in the U.S. See n.178 above.

205 Instruction 4 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO.

206 Item 1007 of Regulation M-A.

207 When securities are offered the registration statement requirements prevail. See n.191 above. We also are reducing the financial statements required for acquiring companies in merger proxy statements from three to two years. See Part II.F.2.b above.

208 Item 10 to Schedule TO and Item 1010(a) and (b) of Regulation M-A, as adopted, require financial statements for two fiscal years when the information is material.

209 Item 1010(a)(4), (b)(1) and (3) of Regulation M-A. As proposed, this change also applies to merger proxy statements.

210 See Rule 14d-6(e)(1)(viii) [17 CFR 240.14d-6(e)(1)(viii)]; Instruction B to Rule 13e-4(d)(1)(iv) [17 CFR 240.13e-4(d)(1)(iv)]; and Instruction 2 to Rule 13e-3(e)(3) [17 CFR 240.13e-3(e)(3)].

211 17 CFR 210.1-02(bb).

212 See Part II.G.2.a above discussing when financial statement information is material.

213 Item 1010(c) of Regulation M-A, Instruction 1 to Item 13 of revised Schedule 13E-3, Instruction 6 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO.

214 Item 1010(a)(4), (b)(3) and (c)(5) of Regulation M-A.

215 See Part II.G.2.a above.

216 See Part II.F.2.c above.

217 A "two-tier transaction" is a business combination structured as a cash tender offer followed by a back-end securities transaction, typically a merger, where remaining security holders of the target receive the bidder's securities as consideration.

218 A requirement to disclose pro forma financial information in the first tier of a two-tier transaction extends the Division of Corporation's interpretive position that disclosure of certain material information known to the bidder regarding a planned back-end securities transaction would not result in "gun-jumping" under the Securities Act. See n.23 above.

219 Instruction 5 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO. This instruction requires bidders to provide the financial data specified in Item 3(f) (comparative historical and pro forma per share data) and Item 5 (pro forma financial information required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X) of Form S-4 in the Schedule filed with the Commission. Bidders may provide only the summary financial information specified in Item 3(d), (e) and (f) of Form S-4 in the disclosure document sent to security holders.

220 A bidder that intends to engage in a back-end securities transaction may not avoid the disclosure requirement by not disclosing its intentions because non-disclosure could be a material omission that renders other statements by the bidder false and misleading.

221 The bidder must disclose the historical financial statements specified in Item 1010 of Regulation M-A. See Instruction 5 to Item 10 of new Schedule TO. Historical financial information for the bidder is necessary to present the pro forma financial information in context.

222 The pro forma financial information requirement applies whether the first step is a partial offer or an offer for all outstanding securities. In both cases, a bidder could intend to engage in a back-end securities transaction with the target.

223 As required by Article 11, the pro forma financial information disclosed in the first tier must be accompanied by clear and explanatory footnotes that address the nature of all material pro forma adjustments.

224 Determination of the significance of an acquisition to the acquiror is made in accordance with Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. See Release No. 33-7355 (October 10, 1996).

225 There is no schedule or form accompanying the rule. The required information is disclosed in a "Rule 13e-1 Transaction Statement" filed electronically on EDGAR under the submission-type SC 13E1.

226 If a target is making an issuer tender offer and complies with the filing, disclosure and dissemination requirements of Rule 13e-4 before repurchasing any securities, the requirements of Rule 13e-1 would be satisfied without a separate Rule 13e-1 filing.

227 17 CFR 240.14a-7.

228 See Release No. 34-40678 (December 15, 1998 [63 FR 69136] (the "Cross-Border Proposing Release") and the Cross-Border Adopting Release.

229 These additional exceptions, one for purchases during cross-border tender offers and one for purchases by "connected exempt market makers" and "connected exempt principal traders," are discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing and Adopting Releases.

230 15 U.S.C. 78j; 15 U.S.C. 78m; 15 U.S.C. 78n.

231 Release No. 34-8712 (October 8, 1969) [34 FR 15836] (the "Rule 10b-13 Adopting Release").

232 Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act confers on the Commission the authority to define and prescribe means to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices in connection with any tender offer. See United States v. O'Hagan , 117 S. Ct. 2199, 2217 (1997) (holding that "under 14(e), the Commission may prohibit acts, not themselves fraudulent under the common law or 10(b), if the prohibition is `reasonably designed to prevent . . . acts and practices [that] are fraudulent'" ( citing 15 U.S.C. 78n(e)).

233 As proposed, we are amending Rule 30-3 delegating exemptive authority to the Director of the Division of Market Regulation, and replacing references to Rule 10b-13 with Rule 14e-5. We also are adding a parallel provision to Rule 30-1 [17 CFR 200.30-1] to delegate exemptive authority to the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, and by operation of Rule 30-5(b) [17 CFR 200.30-05(b)], to the Director of the Division of Investment Management. The amended text of Rule 30-1 appears in the Cross-Border Adopting Release.

234 See Rule 10b-13 Adopting Release.

235 See n.12 above.

236 See new Rule 165(f)(3) and revised Rules 13e-4(c) and 14d-2(b).

237 Rule 10b-13 applies from the time the offer is publicly announced or otherwise made known to security holders until the offer expires. The phrase "otherwise made known" means any form of communication, other than public announcement, that notifies holders of subject securities of an offer.

238 We asked whether the rule should apply if the offeror advises some but not all security holders that it intends to conduct a tender offer for the subject securities. Two of the three commenters that addressed this point believed that a communication to some security holders should not commence the restricted period. These two commenters opposed any such change because it would make negotiations impossible without triggering the rule. We agree with these commenters in that it is not appropriate for private negotiations that do not notify security holders more generally to trigger the rule.

239 Expiration includes termination by the offeror as well as reaching the time the offeror is required, by the offer's terms, either to accept or reject the tendered securities.

240 See Part II.G.1 above.

241 See , e.g. , Letter regarding Offers for Smith New Court PLC (July 26, 1995) ("Smith New Court Letter"). See also In the Matter of Trinity Acquisition's Offer to Purchase the Ordinary Shares and American Depositary Shares of Willis Corroon Group plc , Release No. 34-40246 (July 22, 1998) [67 S.E.C. Docket 1320].

242 In a negotiated transaction, we would consider the target company to be acting in concert with the offeror.

243 17 CFR 240.12b-2.

244 Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.12b-2] defines an "affiliate" of, or a person "affiliated" with, a specified person, as a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.

245 See , e.g. , Part II.G.5.d. below, where we extend the exception for intermediary transactions to include affiliates of the dealer-manager.

246 "Subject securities" are defined in Item 1000 of Regulation M-A as "the securities or class of securities that are sought to be acquired in the transaction or that are otherwise the subject of the transaction."

247 17 CFR 240.10b-13(c).

248 17 CFR 240.13e-4(h)(5).

249 Release No. 34-38068 (December 20, 1996) [61 FR 68587]. This class exemption permitted "any issuer or agent acting on behalf of an issuer in connection with an odd-lot offer to purchase or arrange to purchase the security that is the subject of the offer." The release also states that the exemption, among other things, "will allow the issuer or its agent to purchase the issuer's securities to satisfy requests of odd-lot holders to "round-up" their holdings to 100 shares." 61 FR at 68587-8.

250 Letter regarding Reuters Holdings PLC (August 17, 1993).

251 Cf. Rule 10b-10(a)(2)(ii)(A) [17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(2)(ii)(A)].

252 This exception is not available unless the obligation under the contract is the purchase by the covered person. For example, a purchase necessitated by an obligation to deliver pursuant to a contract is not covered.

253 The staff of the Division of Market Regulation has taken no-action positions under Rule 10b-13 under similar facts and circumstances. See , e.g. , Letter regarding Select Sector SPDRs (December 22, 1998).

254 We base this language on a similar provision in Rule 101(b)(6)(i) of Regulation M [17 CFR 242.101(b)(6)(i)].

255 Cf. Rule 100(b) of Regulation M [17 CFR 242.100(b)]. In the Proposing Release, we asked whether we should consider provisions like those contained in the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers ("City Code") that permit market makers affiliated with the offeror's advisors to continue their market making functions when the market maker is sufficiently independent from the advisor and other protections are present. Three commenters agreed that some exception should be provided for market making activities, and one opposed an exception based on the City Code. This exception for purchases by an affiliate of the dealer-manager permits market making activities by affiliates of the dealer-manager.

257 Cf. Rule 100(b) of Regulation M.

258 See new Rule 165 and revised Rules 14a-12, 14d-2 and 14d-9.

259 As discussed below, we are adopting new Rule 14e-8 to specifically prohibit certain conduct that would mislead investors.

260 Under the exemptions adopted, all written communications relating to a proposed transaction following first public announcement must be publicly filed.

261 See new Rule 165(c) and revised Rules 13e-4(c), 14a-12(a), 14d-2(b), and 14d-9(a).

262 No proxy card or form of proxy may be given or requested unless preceded or accompanied by a proxy statement.

263 Forms S-4 and F-4 are already subject to the plain English requirements; thus we are not requiring a summary term sheet for securities offerings.

264 See Mergers & Acquisitions, The Dealmaker's Journal, 1998 Almanac (March/April 1999), at 42.

265 For the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, we estimate in Table 2 of Part VII the burden hours imposed on parties to comply with the current rules. Assuming (as we did for the proposed rules) that 25% of the hours required to comply with the rules are provided by corporate staff at a cost of $63/hour (70% of the expended corporate staff time cost $85/hour, whereas 30% of the expended corporate staff time cost $10/hour), and 75% of the hours required to comply with the rules are provided by external professional help at a cost of $175/hour, we estimate that affected parties spend approximately 1,110,670 burden hours/year * $147/hour = $163,268,490/year.

281 Although Regulations S-K and S-B do not actually impose reporting burdens directly on public companies, for administrative convenience, we have assigned each of these regulations one burden hour. The burden hours imposed by the disclosure regulations are included in the estimates for the forms that refer to the regulations.

282 Forms S-4 and F-4 are currently subject to summary and plain English requirements. Therefore, we are not requiring a plain English summary term sheet for business combination transactions that are registered on one of these forms.

283 The estimated filings/year are based on the number of filings in fiscal year 1998.

284 The numbers in Column B of Table 2 differ significantly from those in Column A of Table 2 for two reasons. First, the estimated burden hours in Column A include the estimated corporate burden hours and outside labor hours that filers would require to file each disclosure document. In Column B, we estimate only the corporate burden hours needed to file each disclosure document (we estimate separately the expense, in dollar terms, of outside labor). Second, the estimates in Column B include the estimated burden hours that bidders would require to file pre-filing communications. Because parties would require less time to file communications than full Schedule 14As, the average estimated burden hours in Column B are lower than in Column A.

285 Under the amendments, bidders will file their pre- and post-filing written communications relating to a business combination transaction under Rule 425 in transactions where securities are offered as consideration.

286 This estimate is based on data from the Securities Data Corporation indicating that security holders had received only cash in 34% of the merger transactions reported in 1996.

287 We base this estimate on the burden imposed by a similar filing requirement under Item 901(c) of Regulation S-K for roll-up transactions.

288 We base this estimate on 52.50 hours of professional labor/full Schedule 14A filing * $175/hour. In aggregate, we estimate that filers will spend $90,887,696/year to file 9,892 full Schedule 14As/year.

289 Under the amendments, bidders will file under Rule 425 pre- and post-filing written communications relating to a business combination transaction where securities are offered as consideration.

290 This estimate is based on data from the Securities Data Corporation indicating that in security holders had received only cash in 34% of merger transactions in 1996.

291 We base this estimate on 52.50 hours of professional labor/full Schedule 14C filing * $175/hour. In aggregate, we estimate that filers will spend $2,324,564/year to file 253 full Schedule 14Cs/year.

292 We base this estimate on 102.94 hours of professional labor/full Schedule 13E-3 filing * $175/hour. In aggregate, we estimate that filers will spend $1,729,440/year to file 96 full Schedule 13E-3s/year.

293 Under the amendments, bidders must file under Rule 425 any pre- or post-filing written communications in business combination transactions where securities are offered as consideration.

294 This estimate is based on data from the Securities Data Corporation and Mergerstat , indicating that security holders received only cash in 37% of merger and tender offer transactions in 1996.

295 We base this estimate on 264.19 hours of professional labor/full Schedule 14D-9 filing * $175/hour. In aggregate, we estimate that filers will spend $11,928,114/year to file 258 full Schedule 14D-9s/year.

296 Offerors currently require 232 hours to complete Schedule 13E-4, and 354.25 hours to complete Schedule 14D-1. In fiscal year 1998, offerors registered 139 business combinations on Schedule 13E-4 and 257 business combinations on Schedule 14D-1. We estimate the number of burden hours to file a full Schedule TO will be [(139 Schedule TO filings that previously would have been filed on Schedule 13E-4 * 232 hours/Schedule TO filing that previously would have been filed on Schedule 13E-4) + (257 Schedule TO filings that previously would have been filed on Schedule 14D-1 * 354.25 hours/Schedule TO filing that previously would have been filed on Schedule 14D-1) - 2 burden hours from simplification]/396 filings on Schedule TO = 309 hours/filing on Schedule TO.

297 Under the new rules, bidders must file under Rule 425 any pre-filing communications in transactions where securities are offered as consideration.

298 According to Mergerstat , in 1996 security holders received only cash in 78% of tender offer transactions.

299 We base this estimate on 231.75 hours of professional labor/ full Schedule TO filing * $175/hour. In aggregate, we estimate that filers will spend $16,060,176/year to file 396 full Schedule TOs/year.  http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7760.htm
