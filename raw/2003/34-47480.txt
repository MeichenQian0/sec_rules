<h>I. DiscussionA. Introduction </h><h>A. Introduction </h>

On June 10, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") proposed amending its broker-dealer customer protection rule, Rule 15c3-3, and one of its authority delegation rules, Rule 30-3.<sup> 3 </sup> The proposed amendments would allow the Commission to expand the categories of collateral broker-dealers may pledge when borrowing customer securities.<sup> 4 </sup> Today, the Commission is adopting the amendments.

The amendment to Rule 15c3-3 provides that broker-dealers may pledge such collateral as the Commission designates by order after giving consideration to the collateral's liquidity, volatility, market depth, and location, and the issuer's creditworthiness. This will give the Commission greater flexibility to impose conditions on the pledging of certain collateral to account for differences among collateral types. This flexibility will permit the establishment of safeguards designed to ensure that the rule's objective — the receipt of full collateral by customers — is not compromised. The amendment also will allow for a wider range of broker-dealer assets to be deemed permissible collateral, thereby adding liquidity to the securities lending markets and lowering borrowing costs for broker-dealers. The amendment to Rule 30-3 will allow the Commission to react sooner to changes in the securities lending markets.<h>B. Background </h>

The Commission adopted Rule 15c3-3 in 1972 in response to a congressional directive to create rules regarding, among other things, the acceptance, custody, and use of customer securities.<sup> 5 </sup> The rule requires broker-dealers to take steps to protect the securities that customers leave in their custody. These steps include the requirement that broker-dealers promptly obtain and thereafter maintain possession or control of all "fully paid"<sup> 6 </sup> and "excess-margin"<sup> 7 </sup> securities carried for the accounts of customers<sup> 8 </sup> ("customer securities"). The possession or control requirement is designed to ensure that broker-dealers do not put customers at risk by borrowing their securities to expand or otherwise further the broker-dealer's proprietary activities. 

Paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 15c3-3 sets forth conditions under which broker-dealers may borrow fully paid or excess margin securities from customers for their own use without violating the rule's possession or control requirement. These conditions include the requirement that broker-dealers and their lending customers enter into written agreements that (1) set forth the basis of compensation for the loans as well as the rights and liabilities of the parties in the borrowed securities, (2) require the broker-dealers to provide the lenders with schedules of the securities actually borrowed, (3) require the broker-dealers to provide the lenders with, at least, 100% collateral consisting exclusively of cash, United States Treasury bills and notes, or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank, and (4) contain a prominent notice that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970<sup> 9 </sup> may not protect the lenders with respect to the securities loan transactions.<sup> 10 </sup> Moreover, the loaned securities and pledged collateral must be marked to market daily, and additional collateral posted if necessary to maintain the 100% collateralization requirement.<sup> 11 </sup> These requirements are designed so that borrowings of customer securities remain fully collateralized for the term of the loan.<h>C. Proposing Release and Comments </h>

In addition to the collateral types currently permitted, the amendment to Rule 15c3-3 would allow broker-dealers to pledge such other collateral as the Commission designates by order after giving consideration to the collateral's liquidity, volatility, market depth and location, and the issuer's creditworthiness. The relative weight given these factors will vary on a case-by-case basis. The Commission's orders may impose limitations and conditions on the use of a particular type of collateral depending on its characteristics. This will further the rule's goal of providing customers with full collateral while their loans remain outstanding. 

The Commission received three comment letters in response to the proposing release — one from a broker-dealer that engages in borrowings of customer securities,<sup> 12 </sup> one from a bank that lends its clients' securities to broker-dealers,<sup> 13 </sup> and a joint letter from two trade associations, which collectively represent broker-dealers, mutual fund companies and banks.<sup> 14 </sup> All three expressed support for the proposed amendment.<sup> 15 </sup>

In the proposing release, the Commission requested comment on whether authority to issue orders should be delegated to the Division. Two commenters provided comments on this proposal. Both expressed support for such a delegation of authority.<sup> 16 </sup>

The Commission identified in the proposing release categories of collateral being considered for an order should the amendment to Rule 15c3-3 become effective.<sup> 17 </sup> It also set forth certain conditions for the use of these collateral types. The Commission sought comment on whether the collateral and conditions were appropriate. All commenters supported the issuance of such an order.<sup> 18 </sup> The Commission intends to issue an order exempting these collateral types after the amendment becomes effective.

The Commission also sought comment on whether institutional lenders of securities should be allowed to negotiate collateral agreements other than those required by Rule 15c3-3. Two of the commenters responded that the Commission should consider whether the minimum requirements are necessary for certain narrowly defined institutional customers. However, they also urged the Commission to act quickly on the amendment as proposed and not let such consideration delay its adoption.<sup> 19 </sup> They suggested that any changes to address institutional lenders be accomplished through separate orders or rulemakings. Due to the complexities of the issue and in order to act expeditiously on the proposed amendment, further consideration of any change to the collateral requirements for institutional lenders will be addressed by subsequent Commission action.<h>D. Final Rule </h>

The Commission is adopting a final rule amendment substantially in the form proposed in the proposing release.<sup> 20 </sup> The amendment adds language to paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 15c3-3 providing that broker-dealers may pledge "such other collateral as the Commission designates as permissible by order as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors after giving consideration to the collateral's liquidity, volatility, market depth and location, and the issuer's creditworthiness." This is in addition to the categories of collateral (cash, U.S. treasury bills and notes, and bank letters of credit) currently permitted.<h>II. Paperwork Reduction Act </h>

The Commission stated in the proposing release that the amendment will not require a new collection of information. The amendment does not alter the range of collateral that a broker-dealer can pledge when borrowing customer securities, but instead amends the rule to establish criteria that the Commission will consider when issuing an order allowing additional collateral. The comment letters did not disagree with this assessment. In connection with Rule 15c3-3, the Commission previously submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, a request for approval and received an OMB control number for the rule, OMB control number 3235-0078.<h>III. Costs and Benefits of the Rule Amendments </h>

In the proposing release, the Commission requested comment on the costs and benefits of the amendment to Rule 15c3-3. The Commission estimated that the primary benefits of the amendment would be lowered borrowing costs and increased liquidity in the securities lending markets. All three commenters concurred with this estimate.<sup> 21 </sup> Two commenters also pointed out that the amendment will increase their ability to compete in foreign securities markets.<sup> 22 </sup>

The Commission estimated that there would not be any direct costs associated with the amendment because of its deregulatory nature. The Commission did not receive any comments on this estimate.<h>A. Benefits </h>

The primary benefits of the amendment should be lowered borrowing costs and increased liquidity in the securities lending markets, and greater opportunity for U.S. firms to compete abroad. The current collateral requirements in Rule 15c3-3 make it more economical for broker-dealers to borrow securities from other broker-dealers (which are not customers) since customers must be provided with a limited range of collateral. In such a case, the broker-dealer would be limited to borrowing the securities from broker-dealers agreeable to accepting another type of collateral. Expanding the categories of collateral will increase the supply of eligible lenders, which should decrease costs as a consequence of greater competition. 

On the other side, customers will have the opportunity to enter into more lending transactions with broker-dealers. This will allow them to earn the fees associated with such transactions and thereby realize greater returns on their securities portfolios. The increased opportunities to borrow and lend securities should add liquidity to the securities lending markets.<h>B. Costs </h>

There should not be any direct costs associated with the amendment. It will have no impact on broker-dealers that do not borrow customer securities or customers that do not lend securities. For those who participate in such transactions, the amendment is not imposing any changes as to how they must be structured. As described above, it will provide greater opportunities; however, it also maintains the status quo, and therefore, broker-dealers and customers do not have to avail themselves of these new opportunities. Broker-dealers can continue to pledge the types of collateral currently allowed under the rule and, while new categories of collateral may have risk characteristics that differ from those applicable to currently permitted collateral, customers could choose not to accept new categories of collateral.<h>IV. Effects on Competition, Efficiency, and Capital Formation </h>

Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when engaged in rulemaking where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider whether the action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to consider the impact on competition of any rule proposed under that Act. In addition, the law requires that the Commission not adopt any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in the furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 

The Commission stated in the proposing release, and continues to believe, that the proposed amendment should improve efficiency, competition, and capital formation by adding liquidity to the securities lending markets, lowering the costs of borrowing securities, and providing investors with the opportunity to realize greater returns on their securities portfolios. All commenters agreed that the amendment would increase liquidity and lower borrowing costs.<sup> 23 </sup> In addition, the Commission stated that the amendment should have no anticompetitive effects not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all broker-dealers. The Commission did not receive any comments on this assessment of the possibility of anticompetitive effects. Therefore, the Commission believes that the amendment should have no anticompetitive effects not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.<h>V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </h>

Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act<sup> 24 </sup> requires an agency to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the effects of proposed rules and rule amendments on small entities, unless the agency certifies that the rules and rule amendments, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<sup> 25 </sup> The Chairman of the Commission has certified that the amendment to Rule 15c3-3 would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<sup> 26 </sup> The final amendment is identical to the proposed amendment. Accordingly, there have been no changes to the proposal that would alter the basis upon which the certification was made.<h>VI. Amendment to Rule 30-3 </h>

The Commission has adopted an amendment to Rule 30-3 of its Rules of Organization and Program Management governing delegations of authority to the Director of the Division of Market Regulation ("Director").<sup> 27 </sup> The amendment divides paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 30-3 into two paragraphs, (a)(10)(i) and (ii). Paragraph (a)(10)(i) now contains the previously existing delegation of authority in paragraph (a)(10), which authorizes the Director to find and designate certain broker-dealer accounts as control locations for the purposes of paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 15c3-3.<sup> 28 </sup> Paragraph (a)(10)(ii) contains a new delegation authorizing the Director, under Section 36(a) of the Exchange Act, to exempt types of collateral from certain requirements in paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 15c3-3, provided the collateral exempted by the Division has similar characteristics to collateral previously exempted by the Commission. 

Section 36(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission may by rule, regulation or order exempt any classes of persons, securities or transactions from any rule or regulation under the Exchange Act, provided the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with the protection of investors. The Commission is delegating to the Director its exemptive authority pursuant to Section 36(a) for the limited purpose of exempting collateral types from certain requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 15c3-3. 

The delegation of authority to the Director is intended to conserve Commission resources by permitting the staff to review and act on exemptive applications under Section 36(a) when appropriate. Nevertheless, the staff may submit matters to the Commission for consideration as it deems appropriate. In addition, under Section 4A(b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission retains discretionary authority to review, upon its own initiative or upon application by a party adversely affected, any exemption granted or denied by the Division pursuant to delegated authority. Information concerning the filing of exemptive relief applications can be found in Release No. 34-39624; Rule 240.0-12, 17 CFR 240.0-12.

The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), that this amendment to Rule 30-3 relates solely to agency organization, procedure, or practice. Accordingly, notice and opportunity for public comment, as well as publication 30 days before its effective date are unnecessary. Because notice and comment are not required for this final rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The amendment to Rule 30-3 does not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 as amended. In addition, it will not impose any costs on the public.<h>VII. Statutory Authority </h>
